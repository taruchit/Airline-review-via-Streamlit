This is a project built to learn and understand about building **web based interactive dashboard** using **Streamlit.**
<br />
<br>
The training for Streamlit was done via **Coursera Project Network:** https://coursera.org/share/928b3768b2288b53802624adba5ba2d7
<br>
As the result, the inspiration to build template of the dashboard was taken from the course.
<br />
<br>
**Dataset was taken from Kaggle:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranaybshah/qatar-airways-reviews
<br />
The dataset has 2369 rows and 16 columns. 
<br />
<br>
Thus, we have 2369 customer reviews in the dataset.
<br />
<br>
**URL to access the dashboard:** https://airline-review-dashboard.streamlit.app/
<br />
<br>
The dashboard has three components: -
<br />
<br>
**1. Horizontal slider widget: -**
<br />
Here the user selects the rating between 1 to 10 using horizontal slider. Based on the selection, the dataset is queried for rows with respective ratings. Out of those ratings, one of them is randomly drawn and displayed on the UI.
<br />
<br>
**2. Bar chart: -**
<br />
Here, we view a bar chart to view the frequency of each customer review rating.
<br /> 
Thus: - 
<br />
Rating 1 was received from 152 customers.
<br />
Rating 10 was received from 726 customer.
<br />
<br>
**3. Multi select input: -**
A multi-select input option allows used to select the seat type. Based on the selection, frequency of each rating is observed.
<br>
Thus, it helps us to find how the customer reviews differ based on their seating location.
