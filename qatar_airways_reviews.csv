0,2024-03-02,1,10,“marred by inconveniences”,Mary Le,United Kingdom,2024-03-02," The delay of my flight from Haneda to Doha caused a bit of chaos upon arrival. Despite my efforts to reach the gate promptly, I was denied boarding due to luggage issues, and the lack of assistance added to the frustration. I paid for an Economy Comfort package, which was supposed to include an aisle seat. However, upon boarding, I was informed that no aisle seats were available, despite assurances beforehand. Additionally, my luggage tag was lost during the boarding pass exchange, leading to further uncertainty upon arrival in London. What was meant to be a 19-hour journey turned into a 27-hour ordeal. When I requested assistance from staff regarding a re-arrangement they promised to get back to me within 5-10 minutes, but no one followed up until I reached out again. The security queue at Heathrow on departure from the UK was incredibly long, with a wait time of about 1.5 hours just to get through. Overall, while the crew onboard was courteous and provided great service, the experience was marred by these inconveniences.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Tokyo to London Heathrow via Doha,March 2024,no,,0

When I got to the airport, they didn't put my middle name on the ticket and I didn't have any issues. I paid $2300 to upgrade our seats to business class from Doha to Montreal. Not even an hour into the flight, the seat reclined on its own, pinching my leg. The seat wouldn't stay up the rest of the 13.5 hour flight.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,Doha to Montreal,February 2024,no,,1
2,2024-02-29,1,10,"""no attempt to address our complaint""",Wayne Burgess,Australia,2024-02-29,"  I have sent 5 emails and have only received 2 automatic response emails after initiating our complaint 10 weeks ago. I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been “reserved” were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didn’t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didn’t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled. Our complaint isn’t complex.",Business,Economy Class,Doha to Perth,November 2023,no,A380,1

Layout was good, but not exceptional, I’d rate them maybe 7/10. Landing in Doha, we then had quite a long wait for steps to be brought to the aircraft and then a 10 to 15 minute bus ride to the terminal.

During  booking one has to pay for seats in case one does not want to wait until check-in. On the first leg the crew mechanically did their job. It is ok, but not what you expect from Qatar Airways. Amenity kits are not provided any longer on every flight during the night. Nonetheless you sometimes still find the old welcoming and service oriented Qatar Airways spirit. The crew on the second leg was outstanding as well as ground staff at JRO.

Lounge in Frankfurt a bit underwhelming as Qatar uses Priority Pass Lounge that isn’t up to Qatar‘s standards.

However, they lost my bag at JFK for a week, and when I had to waste a day of my own vacation time to go buy some clothes, they refuse to fully reimburse me and I had to chase and jump through hoops to get any compensation offer from them.

10,2024-02-12,6,10,"""Inflight entertainment was top notch""",M Leasen,United States,2024-02-12,"  When I arrived at my departing airport, Baltimore Washington, my flight was cancelled for my first leg due to bad weather. This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasn't a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights I'd say the first wasn't as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldn't be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didn't get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane. Inflight entertainment was top notch. There were plenty of movies, TV shows and music. The internet was choppy w/ my device so I just stayed w/ the entertainment they provided. I also think the food was great. I enjoyed all meals and they were portioned just right. As for the issue of my refund, I'm still fighting.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Chicago to Dubai via Doha,January 2024,no,,1

At Doha , passengers are jammed in a small boarding area with insufficient seats or air conditioning and the boarding proceeds in an undignified scramble. Once on board, the Qatar quality starts. Welcoming drink, a very spacious Q suite and a comfortable seat. Dinner was delicious with a dry Riesling and later on breakfast was equally good.

13,2024-01-27,1,10,“it was not the standard expected”,Peter Dyson,United Kingdom,2024-01-27," Firstly I must state that on three of the legs of my journey to Penang and back to Birmingham were excellent. On 23 September boarded flight from Penang to Doha. There is a short hop from Penang to Phuket and the crew were very good, a special note for Melissa who was friendly, engaging and attentive and a credit to Qatar Airways. However everything changed when a new crew embarked at Phuket. They were sullen and unsmiling from the outset. Service was abysmal. Tablecloths were given as serviettes and getting a glass of wine or water was like getting blood from a stone. Distribution of food was chaotic. I am not sure if this was the fault of the Cabin Manager or the individual flight attendants or some disagreement among the crew. Whatever, it was not the standard expected from business class on Qatar. Shortly before landing the Cabin Manager did his rounds and I stated I was unhappy with the service...about 10 minutes later he returned and asked for more information. If Qatar Airways read these comments I hope they investigate this matter and it was a blotch on the otherwise excellent service I was provided by other aircrews.",Business,Business Class,Penang to Doha via Phuket,January 2024,N/A,Boeing 777,1

The flight from Ahmedabad to Doha was on scheduled time. When we reached Doha HIA airport the staff told us that our next flight from Doha to Chicago was overbooked and we cannot board. They had us waiting for almost 1 hour saying they are figuring out options for what can be done. After some time they gave us an option of flight to JFK which was after 24 hours. We waited until 26th January at Doha airport. After reaching JFK we were told that connecting flight to Detroit was from another airport (La Guardia). Then we were transferred to La Guardia airport.

15,2024-01-25,2,10,"""no covered canopy on the stairs""",P Craig,Australia,2024-01-25,"  When my flight with Qatar was delayed through no fault of Qatar, fog bound, in Georgia I experienced Qatar at its worst. Planes flew the next morning but we had a 26 hour delay. When they sent us to a very nice hotel they had only one hour person issuing vouchers and hotel arrangements for a plane load. They transferred us to the hotel and we returned to the airport and we sat and watched the following days scheduled flight, that we were meant to be on, leave with passengers and we had to sit and wait another 2 hours, which was consequently delayed another hour through unexplained circumstances which caused for an additional six hour layover in Doha. On checking in again I had a silver pass and there were three of us lined up for business class check in. My friend in economy was 30 deep and she got served before I did. We then had three gate changes without any announcements, we had to find the gates and on the boards there was no information as to what flight was leaving. They bussed us out to the plane on the tarmac in Georgian winter weather, there was no covered canopy on the stairs up to the plane as we stood in the rain waiting to board. I contacted Qatar help on the number given to me by Qatar and they said I have to email ""talk to us"" which only responded to half my email.

Cabin is well-maintained and clean, very spacious for 900/1000 series. The leg space was ample and seat space is great too. The cabin crews are friendly and professional but among them, there is 1 steward who went extra miles to make my journey extra special. He seems like the most junior one but he was very confident and helpful.

I recently had the privilege of experiencing the epitome of airborne luxury aboard the world's best airline, and I must say that the exceptional service provided by the cabin crew left an indelible mark on my travel experience. From the moment I stepped on board until the final descent, every aspect of the journey was a testament to the dedication and professionalism of the airline's remarkable cabin crew. Beyond the technical aspects of the service, what truly set this airline's cabin crew apart was their genuine warmth and hospitality. It was evident that they enjoyed their work and took pride in creating a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for passengers. Whether it was a friendly conversation, a reassuring smile, or going the extra mile to accommodate special requests, the cabin crew consistently exceeded expectations. In conclusion, the world's best airline undoubtedly boasts the world's best cabin crew. Their commitment to excellence, attention to detail, and genuine hospitality set a standard that other airlines would do well to emulate.

Our already booked program and domestic flights did not allow us to cancel and rebook new flights.

On both trips upon arrival at DOH , there was a lengthy bus ride from the plane to the terminal of almost 15-20 min which was followed by a hurried security check and then a sprint to the gate to catch the next flight, which we boarded last, to realize that our initially booked and prepaid seats  were messed up. The issue was smoothly and quickly resolved by the very polite and mindful cabin manager on QR 203 on Dec 17th. In any case, our mixed feelings from our eventful Qatar booking experience, were all surpassed by the positive impression of the cabin crew's extraordinary efficiency and professionality.

Returning check in polite unfortunately KLIA is a dreadful airport, possibly the worst in Asia with poor and uninterested staff along with poor facilities.

On the second occasion I managed to get re-routed using Qatar Airways and this proved to be a welcome lucky break. Both flights were excellent with decent legroom and comfortable seats. Meals were better than expected and FA were both efficient and friendly. I managed to get some sleep on both flights. During the night FA made several runs through the cabin with drinks and snacks for those who were awake. The Doha to Manchester flight was full with only a few spare seats we left Doha late but that was not a airline problem but that of several large family groups of passengers who had not booked seats together but felt that numerous other passengers should be relocated to enable them to be accommodated in a seating arrangement they deemed acceptable.

I recently undertook a Business QSuite Trip from from London to Angola for the cost of circa £5000 and the biggest problem was as a result of an initial 6 hour delay due to problems with the aircraft, we missed the second Qatar Airways flight. As a result Qatar gave us no options but rerouted us down to Johannesburg and then up to Angola. This resulted in a 17 hour journey becoming 32hr, but the biggest problem was the Qatar booked some of this via an alternate airline organised by Qatar Airways, which I can only describe as ancient and worrying. This was meant to be a QSuite flight and was chosen so I could work en-route, arrive refreshed and get to work straight away. I wrote to Qatar Airways on my return and they paid out the initial compulsory delayed compensation and then gave a very generic ""Sorry, we take your feedback seriously"". I have made no progress getting any sort of resolution, all you can get is the generic response). The entire AV system didn't work on one flight - I couldn't charge my laptop on one flight.

Check-in became a hassle, as there were no transfer counters and I had to shift terminal by arriving with Saudia. I was forced to pay for a transit visa, 150 USD, despite I was never on landside and had only 1 hour transit time. This scrupulous exploitation is unacceptable, just taking advantage of people in rush. QR have no transfer desk nor transfer service in a big international airport to where they are flying several times per day. The good thing is that they, upon my request, at least reopened the check-in counter allowing me to check-in even after the minimum time of 60 minutes had elapsed. A lady behind me was also late, but disallowed to check-in, contrary to me. So, at least I got some premium for my hefty visa fee. Boarding was smooth, despite the flight was fully stuffed apart from an empty seat next to me. No alcohol served onboard with reference to a holy national day in Riyadh.

After the machine reads your passport, you get full overview and can print out new BP yourself. Impressive. Short evening flight, less than 1 hour duration. Huge aircraft, virtually full (300 pax?). Briefly on time. Gate boarding functioned well through division of passengers into 4 zones. I was treated with respect and served excellently. Food and drinks were informed online prior to travel, which had raised my expectations. And, it was all there: served a nice, cold Arabian mezze, nicely prepared and presented in a transparent design box separated in food sections with a spoon fixed elegantly across the sections. Softdrinks numerous, but surprisingly, cava “champagne” was served as well as wine, spirits, and beers. Two catering service rounds in 55 minutes is impressive.

71,2023-10-05,1,10,"""missing bag apparently was traced in AMS""",Philip Armstrong,South Africa,2023-10-05,"   It pains me to share this experience as I have always been a big fan of Qatar, having flown on it many times in my career while based in Washington DC and Geneva (business and first class). And, in fact, paid the extra money to upgrade to business class when I retired and returned to South Africa with my wife during the pandemic and it was expertly handled and a very satisfying, secure experience. Checked in at Schipol around noon on Tuesday 26 September travelling QR0274 to Doha, then QR1369 to Cape Town on Wednesday 27 September. Checked in three bags, two were received, and one was not. Reported at CPT on arrival on 27 September and a property irregularity report completed with appropriate supporting information including pics. Since then it has been a nightmare of correspondence and communication with various people in CPT, DOHA and AMS. All to NO avail. No one seems to have the capability, willingness or interest in helping a customer retrieve their missing bag containing valued personal possessions, including our family Holy Bible which is irreplaceable. Apparently the missing bag apparently was traced in AMS and was meant to be loaded on QR0274/29 September to be delivered in CPT on QR1369/30 September. Nothing arrived and there seems to be complete confusion between CPT and Qatar representatives in Doha and AMS. It seems AMS are not responding but I find it hard to believe that Qatar would not physically investigate what is going on at AMS with their baggage handlers, whom I believe are Swissport. I tried Swissport and the Station Manager in AMS but they don't answer their phones. I keep being assured that the bag is on the next flight but nothing. It is now a week since the missing bag was traced and it is just endless communication with people who want nothing to do with the problem and passing the blame to someone else.

On checking in at Jakarta International airport we had to stand and wait for an hour.  When I raised my concern with the staff, they said it was because they have three flights departing at that time.  The lounge was the Garuda Business lounge that was really awful. The only alcoholic beverages available were unpalatable and inferior products.  The ghastly food offering was substandard and inedible. The lounge was cramped, hot and overcrowded. We left the lounge and used the general access / food court section and bought a decent glass of wine and better food. Four weeks before my return flight, Qatar emailed me to say I can not return from Doha to Jakarta in Qsuite because they changed aircraft to one without Q Suite. If If I still want to fly Qsuite, I must catch an alternative flight 7 hours later and wait 9 hours in Doha rather than about 2. Their rules state that I am unable to enter the Doha business lounge until a few hours before my flight, so the rest of the time, I would be locked out of the lounge.

The food options were above average, and there was a good choice of drink options. I did notice that the entertainment system seemed to have a lot less choice of content than when I last flew Qatar Airways, and the leg room felt a little tighter. Arriving to Doha around 11:00 pm meant a huge crowd waiting to get through security. Doha airport is OK. The flight back to Europe meant taking a bus to the plane and this was a bit of a pain. Both flights were completely full. At Bangkok, I asked at the check in counter whether it was a full flight and the guy behind the desk said that it was overbooked.

I strongly suspect that this happened when I upgraded my return flight to business class, a glitch in the system cleared my seat selection for the outbound journey. I wrote to Qatar Airways about it, and they replied that they are free to change seats at any time, including after boarding. There wasn't enough food, 2 meals and one sandwich, and my vegetarian ovo-lacto meal was a vegan meal. There also seemed to be some confusion among the staff, a couple of times they served me a regular meal and then took it away to give me the special meal.

Then we tried when we got to Doha, before security and there was a long queue of other people also trying the same - we were 30 minutes in the queue and they said they couldn't change but someone else said to try at customer service.

Further were sandwiches and snacks served and/or obtainable on request. Both flights were de facto full; this challenges were handled well by the crew who knew how to focus without panicking.

Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision would've saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was 'less than eight hours' (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am 'not a member' When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one.

Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around €350 higher than other configuration. When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but what’s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it! One of the mentioned flights was my 100th on Qatar, about 70% in Business class, but it never happened that there was a aircraft change from an old configuration to Qsuite, only the other way round. On a lighter note, the flights were outstanding, esp. the Bangkok to Doha sector (QR839) with great food and service. I want to thank especially the wonderful and hard working Purser and her team.

These things happen which most people can understand - unfortunately, there were no updates given until passengers became so irate that they demanded the pilot make an announcement to update us (this happened three times). First announcement: apologies due to technical issues currently being worked on by ground staff. Second announcement: apologies, technical issues now resolved - just carrying out paperwork for clearance. Third announcement: apologies due to technical issues - almost resolved now.  Upon landing in Doha, met by a member of ground staff holding a sign, upon asking if the Manchester flight had departed she said yes. Next flight was in 6 hours - the compensation provided was the equivalent of 10GBP - to spend over the 6 hour wait (a coffee alone was 5GBP). Didn't give access to a lounge. Again, customer service upon receiving the 'compensation' and my next boarding pass was poor - no smile, no apology for the inconvenience. I asked out of curiosity why my bag needed to go through a security check when I'd just come from the plane - the response was that the previous airport flying from could have missed something. When flying flying back from Manchester on the return flight via Doha I didn't pass through any security checks to my connecting flight. One plus point to the flights - food is great, hats off to the chef.

First time flying Q-Suite of Qatar Airline, have heard many good things about it prior to departure which turned out to be exactly as advertised. You get your own spacious suite, comfortable seat, plenty of storage, great food, all are better than other business class experiences that I had. What really went well beyond my expectation was the cabin crew. From the time I boarded they have always been super attentive with prompt service of what I needed. Special Kudo to Amit the supervisor, Hattaya who handled my section with a smile that can light up the cabin, plus Chenny and Asil who both were in the front (Apologies to the rest of the wonderful crew whose names I didn't quite remember) Moreover, the lounge in Doha is just fantastic. There have been plenty of praise about the facilities so I am not going to repeat here. However I really want to point out that all the staffs are well-trained and always proactively helping out asking for our needs, which is not something I experienced in most of the business class lounge. They were also very serious about the work product they delivered. We ordered a steak at the dining room that turned out to be too well-done and not tender, we made a very slight comment about it and five minutes later the Chef came out and explained to us that they deliberately didn't leave it too rare and we are all travelers so they want to be on the safe side. The only drawback is the inflight WIFI. $10 for a full flight plan is very reasonable so I purchased it right on board. However after I napped the system could no longer recognize me so I had to make another purchase.

I had travelling sickness, a really hard one after a big turbulence, and I was surprised of how everyone working on board helped me and treated me. They took care of me, asked for doctor and nurse on the plane, they gave me everything that I needed, they let me lay down for 3 hours because was impossible to stay at my seat and they understood and did everything. So Im really glad for it. After that they called the paramedics from Madrid Airport who took me at the exit of the flight and drove me to the hospital where I stayed for all night long.

On the catering side, despite the flight leaving at 2am Qatar should in my opinion have a couple of full meals available for passenger who do not want to sleep right away.

As usual service and in flight offerings were excellent - apart from one thing. Generally I have never worked out why QR pilots announce the start of descent about an hour before touch down when in fact the aircraft does not start descending until about 25 minutes beforehand. In this short overnight flight of less than 6 hours, that cuts sleep time. Specifically, this is the second time I have had QR flight attendants prior to departure take my breakfast requests and serving time, and then get it hopelessly wrong! This time I wished merely coffee, juice and two croissants with marmalade as late as possible. I was asked if this meant about two hours or one hour prior ro landing. I stated one hour. When I was wakened, I discovered it was two hours prior to landing. I then waited about 20 minutes before another FA tried to set up my table for a full breakfast. Asking her to look at the request sheet, there was no apology. Eventually I got an orange juice and a full bread basket with just one croissant. Asking for a second croissant, yet another full bread basket arrived. Only later when I had finished the croissants and juice did the coffee appear. When so much else is so good, this is surely a major error on an overnight flight. It certainly left me in a less than good mood",Business,Business Class,Doha to Bangkok,March 2023,N/A,Boeing 777,1

Seats were good quality and design, but narrow on the 777 especially (10 seats across) even though the leg-room was good. The newest of their aircraft was the best to fly on - the A350, with a roomy and airy feeling, with high ceiling. The in-flight experience was mostly good, but they could be more generous with drinks and snacks between meals. Children don't always eat at the designated times during the flight. The worst part of our experience was the structure of the ground service and connections. We had to re-check our bags in Tokyo for the domestic flights, security checks in-transit in Doha, buses for the Dublin flight in Doha, and QR don't issue boarding passes for the JAL domestic connection.

Even using my miles I would refrain to use them on 1st unless I had to forego them. Their excellent business class makes 1st class almost superfluous. The product is conservative, amazing space, and care level as the pax desires. QR markets their 1st class as a “relish the myriad of exclusive offerings”. Business class is similar (better?) and provides better value for the money. A single spoon of Pearl caviar doesn’t make it. The original can was displayed upon request. Sparkling wines in First are expensive, branded Rare and Alexandra (both ex. 2006), but Business has 2 fine champagnes, which are cheaper and good.  The interior of cabin is dull, conservative, with brownish un-inspirational colors. Access to Bar is fine but not only a 1st Class privilege. Tried to preselect food for weeks before flying but it does not work from my departing cities. Could not  access a menu in advance. Lounges, food, space, and service is better than business class. Welcome champagnes on board; given kit and a quality pyjamas. Champagnes served are truly expensive in contrast to the meagre, cheap, industrial sub-quality beers they could offer. Leffe was the least poor. On QR, I have never been able to get an IPA or porter beer. Food not much better than business class, a spoon of Pearl caviar and a deshelled, dry lobster hand does not make the justification nor significant difference.  Had hoped for some outstanding food, but it was close to ordinary. IFE fine big screen. Ground and Luggage: QR has ground handling problems. They refused to relabel my bags to final destination. Staff disregarded QR’s partnership with Rwandair, resulting me to lose my luggage transfer to final destination. Neither QR in Doha nor in BKK were willing to fix it. However, Rwandair fixed it eventually and opted to board me but leaving my bags 2 days behind in Doha before next flight to Kigali. Had to accept. Partnerships with Rwandair has problems of non-aligned systems, separate bookings, BPs not issued reversely, luggage transfer failures, no full lounge access reciprocality. BOOKING Very hard to come around vacant award seats in F, so I had to plan an entire journey around a leg found (BKK-DOH) to accommodate it. Award booking with QR took weeks to book, coordinate, manage, and process.

He replied ""flight is full you, you need to go to Customer Service"". And I asked politely why there is a seating number and why I was even been checked in if the flight is full? I asked if he could please check once everyone is on board if there is still capacity in any the plane, I stood there and asked if he could recheck.

On the Boeing 787-8 the legroom was awful and restrained by a large inflight entertainment box under the seat in front, the seat was quite hard, and the headrest could not be adjusted on the sides.

Terrible seat pitch. Tiny, faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabin-approved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi, it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight, so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep, I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner, which I clearly did not.

Even on relatively short 4 hour flights there were pillows and blankets on each seat. IFE was decent, with a wide selection of movies and programmes to choose from. The food was all of a high standard - a good selection (usually 3 choices) of meals, and each was tasty and filling. I was very impressed with the alcohol selection - a sparkling wine (rare in economy class), quality red and white wine, two beers, and a small selection of spirits. Most impressive of all was the service: the crew were friendly, attentive, and polite. Drink runs were regular, and staff were engaging and highly professional. On one leg with few passengers, the staff were wonderful - constantly checking up on us, offering more drinks, proactively offering to make a festive cocktail (in economy class!), and ensuring our comfortable.

The usual remote bus transfer in Doha. I can’t recall any airbridge arrival/departure (besides A380 flights) over the past 2 years. Reminds me of the old Doha Airport. Bus transfer took ages this time, because of a very remote position of aircraft and several long stops on the way.

Smooth cooperation with their new partner Rwandair by whom I arrived with in Doha early morning coming from Kigali. The Platinum lounge that I chose in Doha, appears to be the “flagship” among three newer frequent flyer lounges in Doha for Oneworld silver, gold, and platinum card holders. It had a la carte dining, champagne, showers, tarmac view, sleeping areas. Seat prebooked provided and automatically changed to fit into new aircraft type. Due to New Year, flight was full, likely overbooked despite changed to larger aircraft in last Minute. Seat-block or upgrade was not possible. I was respected as frequent flier and given exit row without charges. Dinner details were announced on their homepage already 2-3 weeks prior to flight, what an impressive effort (“Preview Onboard Menu”); they provided 3 options, all found available. I chose Teriyaki chicken and later beef ragout with mashed potatoes, all good. I prefer this proper dinner and do not mind they skipped breakfast. A Spanish cava sparkling wine was offered as one of 3 wines onboard; beers industrial and watery: only Stella Artois and Budwiser. Food concept always with narrow options and slim concepts over the last 15 years. Conservative airline, lacks life, colours, and innovation, though quite predictable and faultless. FAs well-rested, groomed, but deprived of charm. IFE was good with individual quality monitors; quality headsets were provided to all; likewise blankets, pillows, and amenity kits. Aircraft and toilets were well kept. Despite I had a complex booking issued by an online travel agent, it was easy to handle and detail on airline’s homepage. Miles were credited separately to the different airlines' (QR and WB) frequent flier programs without issues. I did not see my luggage in Bangkok: it was transferred smoothly the entire route from Africa to Saigon. This, even it was partly mislabeled at its inscribed origin in Kigali to final destination in SE-Asia with Vietnam Airlines who is in the competing Skyteam alliance.

Flight entertainment was ok, but the touchpads of the Oryx One systems were not working smoothly, in the B787 it was ok, but in the 737 it was barely usable, very disappointed by that. We were very disappointed by the Qatar Airways website and mobile app. How is it possible that a world class airline cannot set up properly maintained online services? The homepage and app crashed several times, didn't accept our discount vouchers that are available to new customers. The chat support is also very poor, as it took us over 1 hour to discuss a simple change of our booking. In general customer service is bad.

And I want to mention that there is a difference between the aircraft types 777-300ER and A350-900.

All in all, a pretty good way to get from point A to point B. I do have 2 small issues with Qatar Airways, they seem to have a tendency for last minute equipment change (meaning you might have booked a QSuite flight only to be told later you're getting an older aircraft). But this could be deal breaker for us, they seem to have an inclination to 'take you out' of your chosen seat and place you in a less desirable seat (at least less desirable for you).

Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the world's best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes.

This proved to be the correct strategy. I slept for the first 2 hours and then after waking, ordered the ""pulled beef"" burger, which was tolerable. Staff as always were friendly, and extremely eager to please. They expressed the desired level of concern at the abysmal check-in at Madrid operated by Iberia. Having checked-in online, but gone to the Business Class check-in desk the check in clerk questioned Thailand residency (my final destination) proof, (not required, but which I had in my passport, which he then disputed, until I explained it line by line). He then added luggage tags to 2 bags under my companion's name only, and omitted to put on priority tags.

Check-in in BKK a breeze, and certainly not the 3 hours suggested by the airline, especially after online check-in. But onboard service a major disappointment. Meal service was haphazard and chaotic. Was the last to be asked for my first course order, despite being in the middle of the cabin, and they had run out. I opted to forgo it. Instead they provided an ad hoc 1 prawn dish with a slice or two of avocado. The next course took nearly 1 hour to arrive, and I took one look at it when it did, and just ordered a cheese plate instead, finished it and went to sleep. No mattress service on this sector, despite it being night time. My travelling companion on the other side received an equally strange service level. I received my drink order of a glass of champagne, and he received his 40 minutes later. Dinner, such as it was, was completely uncoordinated. However good on paper, the a la carte dining concept does not work, and my suggestion is it should be abolished. The staff were very apologetic and, but seemed very inexperienced.

Having taken that, I realised it was 2 hours too early, and I should have slept until the hour before arrival. Cabin staff the usual friendly people, but the quality of food and miserly portion, made me think it would have been best to skip the F&B service, and sleep until descent, for the early (8 am) arrival in Madrid.

The Ground staff were very nice and helpful. Check-in was a smooth process, I had exceeded the baggage allowance by a small margin. No fuss created. Flight lifted off on time. The A330 is a bit outdated but good enough for the 3 hr flight to Doha. Arrival was on-time and we were off into HIA’s Main Concourse. Transit was smooth. I did some shopping from QDF and had dinner from Burgerie (Food Court - South) HIA is normally busy in the early mornings due to most long-haul flights being scheduled around the same time (US/UK/EU/China/South Korea/AUS/NZ) But it didn’t cause any problems apart from extra waiting times at the Food court. As soon as I was done I came to see the “Final Call” 40 mins before departure for QR329 to London. Which meant I had to hurry up. As soon as I got to the Gate they called Zone 1 and I was first to board. I got comfortable in my seat. Pushback for this flight was on time. However the passenger next to me was quite disturbing in the flight. She persistently kept a sleeping angle which directly meant less space for me which was very uncomfortable on the night flight. I did not take any meals on this flight as I was full. Although I did hydrate myself regularly. After a couple of shows and a few hours of sleep we started descent into Gatwick and we landed at around 0630AM. De boarding was efficient and we were clear of all arrival procedures within 15 min and I was on my way on the 166 mile drive home. I won’t be using Gatwick again because of its location.

Lounge in Bangkok downgraded to become the 3rd party Miracle Lounge, which at a first glance appear nice but de facto is fairly useless and sterile. No bar, no soft chairs, outdoor area closed off, food is lousy, no music, no wines, no personal service nor attention. Boarding smooth and from jetbridge. Onboard, got an excellent, priority seat on upper deck which rendered a premium feeling. Got a lot of attention from FAs who recognised my gold-card status, treated me with respect, pleasure, provided options and recommendations on food and drinks, and went beyond their mandate to please me. I brought own wine-glasses to avoid drinking from plastic mugs – this is the faith of travelling economy. Wines and food was good. Its much better to depart early evenings more than after midnight as you are served proper dinner. Good IFE. Annoying safety video with Barcelona footballers has now gone on for 5 years without being replenished. Eternal charity calls on Educate a Child is inappropriate. Departure delayed 1 hour due to heavy downpour in Bangkok, causing ½ hour late arrival, which is acceptable.

The amenity kit supplied by Diptyque Paris. Alcohol and beverage selection on Business class was generous. The IFE was very up-to-date with many of the latest movies from all around the world, no lagging or dead screens. Prices were reasonable and we were glad that none of our flights were subject to unreasonable delays and all of them arrived on time. I found  Doha Airport incredibly crowded. The lounges were full during peak transit time, and then magically empty out once outgoing planes have departed. Nevertheless, still a very decent option at such a price point.

On both flights, the seats were comfortable, esp. they had enough leg space for me (175 cm tall), and both had a power socket available just below the seat. I reclined on the second flight only, and it felt like a standard, good recline angle to me. The service started a bit late on both flights well past an hour of flight. The food was rather mediocre this time, but I appreciated real cutlery and a good selection of drinks. Boarding and disembarking weren't that great because both times (actually four times) it was done with a rather crowded bus. On the second flight boarding early meant spending more time in a hot bus waiting for the remaining passengers to arrive. I haven't used an entertainment system, but I was impressed with the screen size and quality on the first flight. Sadly WiFi was available only on the second flight when I didn't really need it. I tried it because one hour of complimentary free access was advertised, but it didn't work for me. I could barely log in and after I still had no actual internet connectivity. This time I discovered that the Qatar app allows you to track the luggage, which given all the mess happening right now with lost luggage around the world was quite comforting to see that the luggage was actually loaded onto the plane. Sadly, the app is a bit quirky to use as the luggage tracking is not available straight from the booking and requires providing a booking number.

This was a personal trip. While I have been to US several times over last 17 years - for business as well as personal trips, it was a first trip to US for my son. My son will be pursuing MS at USC in LA and hence he needed extra luggage allowance. My past experience with Qatar is the primary reason I booked our flights with Qatar, though it was not the cheapest option. I wanted to make sure that, even if I had to cancel my travel plan at last minute, my son will have hurdle free journey. However, I was happy that I chose Qatar Airways. Every stage - flight booking, seat & meal selection, check-in, in-flight exp, meals & snacks, in-flight entertainment, baggage handling - was a pleasant experience. Qatar provided extra luggage allowance as student allowance to my son. Qatar also provided full-flight complimentary wi-fi to him as a student offer. We are vegetarians. Almost all airlines have vegetarian meal option but a handful provide good quality and tasty veg meals. Qatar veg meal was excellent. So was their choice of snacks and beverages. Staff was polite and friendly though we were in Economy. I have noticed a stark difference in airline staff behavior when they deal with Business versus Economy class passengers. Even in Economy, their staff was cordial and caring. There were several passengers with variety of queries ranging from meal options to why satellite-based wi-fi was not working at certain times. Staff was answering and helping passengers with genuine interest. A couple of suggestions : 1) Qatar should consider waiving off seat selection fees for middle seats. I had to pay for it as I wanted to make sure I travel together with my son 2) I am not sure if Qatar provides confirmation notification about successful luggage transfer in connecting flights. If they don't then they must consider providing this notification as it will serve as a huge relief for the passengers that their luggage is not left behind.

Firstly the Business Class Lounge catering to Qatar Airways Business Class passengers was closed? We went to other lounges but they were full and would not accept us, eventually we found a lounge that did offer us seats in their reception area. The snack food was truly below par, so too was the extremely poor selection of beverages.

They understood the situation (the booking was mistakenly done in my wife's maiden name which not her current passport)- although we also her maiden name passport when traveling as it has her visa in it. The pressure and stress of traveling was taken away in an instance and we ended up having the rest of our journey stress free.

A350-1000 is one of the most modern planes in operation. The seats were very comfortable despite their thin appearance. There was no tailbone pain during the 15 hour trip from SFO to DOH. There was enough leg room in the first row after business class - Row 16. The best seats on this plane are 31A and 31K as there are no seats in front of them and you get a window too. The next best seats are 17C and 17H, those are aisle seats with no seats in front. Qatar' economy food was pretty good and sufficient. The AVML choices are offered in the standard menu so no need to order special meals. The quality of food was surprisingly good in all segments. Not too oily, spicy. Doha airport gets too crowded in the central area, which is the only downside in the whole trip. The service onboard was pretty good with the crew being quite responsive to your needs.

We called Customer Service Hotline immediately to understand the situation and our options. However, we were only told to contact Qatar Airways Customer Care via portal/email. We lodged our concerns to seek alternative arrangements and or suitable recovery efforts at Doha Airport. To-date we have not heard from QR office despite 2 email reminders. Upon landing at Doha Airport, we approached Qatar Airways Transit Desk to listen to what recovery arrangements have been made for affected passengers. We requested for a ‘Flight disruption letter’ to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation / lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures.

Of course I expected Qatar airways that if they change my flight, they also change my seat to the new route/plane for the fee, which I had paid for the original itinerary. With every change Qatar made, I had to call customer service, explain my entire problem and have endless discussions about why I do not pay again for a new seat assignment, if Qatar is the one to change my flights.

It was disappointing that Qatar seems not to re-open its flagship lounge at BKK airport after more than 2 years of closure. Does not make sense to use a very mediocre Miracle lounge since number of flights are back to pre Covid, and airfares about 40% higher in comparison to pre Covid times. Flight was uneventful, food was nothing to shout about. Champagne was uncoiled, red wine was ice cold. I was glad that my flight from Doha was from B2 gate and not the usual bus station like E area. I could not be more wrong. They used an empty airbridge gate and used buses from there. The worst part was to sit in an very hot aircraft with an open door on the tarmac with a very weak aircondition. Generally, Doha Airport has lost its advantage over other airports and is the weakest part of the overall experience while flying Qatar. The flight to Warsaw was good, with better service and food in comparison to my first leg of the journey. There are no more amenity kits for Doha to Europe flights. When I asked about it, I was told that there are no more kits for flights below 6h. Both of my flights were 5.5h; but the BKK to Doha sector had a lovely amenity kit.

I was given pyjamas to use on the flight, they were comfortable. The A380 has a very impressive lounge with very few people using it at the time I went which meant that the air stewardess who was on duty could take time to chat.

Check-in in CPH quick and pleasant, done within Minutes, which gave me almost 4 hours in lounges as the many counters opens 4 hours prior to departure. I was given plenty of seat options as flights were full/about to be full. The Eventyr Lounge that they use is nice and improving, the view is gorgeous. Smooth boardings and deboardings, all on jet-bridges. I oppose the by far too early gate calls, 80 Minutes before departure in CPH, despite gate is only 3 Minutes away from lounge. Lounge in DOH has changed to the new Silver Lounge at B-gates. Its roomy and nice though 1-2 steps below the level of the Al Mourjan lounge – on the other hand it provides tarmac views as the only of its kind in Doha. Onboard, a breeze of service, FA attention, and recognition of status level. 3 hot meals offered from CPH, I tried 2 of them, they were quite good. Drinks rounds and offerings were plenty, incl sparkling wine on both flights. Last flight there were 2 hot breakfast option, I craved for a 3rd option and they managed to deliver it to perfection after only 20 Minutes additional waiting. Impressive on a full flight. Managed to sleep 3 hours on the last flight in an exit row seat with meters ahead of me for leg stretching. IFE was top notch with 150+ movies, the best I have had on any economy flight.

Then from my 3rd trip and on, they used the older 777 300ERs, they do not have the same seats, and the entertainment system and the screens are very slow to respond. The worst part is when you try to lay down; your feet are always dangling and not even with your body. It feels more like a long recliner than a lie-flat seat.  They offer newer 777s and some even with Q suites on shorter routes, I enjoyed when I flew from Doha to Istanbul or to Dhaka.

Whether a policy written by QR after the purchase of the ticket actually entitles QR to cancel my points is in my view moot. QR canceled the booking, then forfeited my points and gave me no notice of pending forfeiture (in Feb 2022). They restricted me to a two year window to rebook in circumstances where rebooking was infeasible due to COVID related travel restrictions. My point is why give a loyal customer the run around?

When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a £40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve ‘preferred’ seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all.

There was no candle and no salt and pepper dispenser for my lunch. Also, no amenity kit for Warsaw to Doha flights. The Doha to Bangkok flight was better, with a caring inflight supervisor and better service. Unfortunately, I booked a seat close to the galley. The crew was rather lively throughout the night, which kept me awake.

The Wi-Fi was very slow and I did not use the entertainment system. The food was the best tasting and presentation I have ever had on any flight I have taken since I started flying in the early 1970s especially the scallops and ossobuco. The Caviar was more on the cheaper Sevruga type and the strawberry pie was masked with too much sugar to give your taste buds a chance to see it’s quality but to put an item on the menu as “Qatari grown chicken“ does not do any positive advertising for the country because it does not show these chicken are free range or organic fed or even antibiotic free - that issue has to be addressed sooner rather than later.

Yet having changed the first outward plane from the original booking 4 months earlier, my seat was changed from 2K to 10K. Although QR had my phone and email, at no time did the airline attempt to contact me. At the airport I refused to sit in the second cabin. It was only thanks to a member of the ground staff who persuaded someone in 3K to change with me. The lounge at BKK was not the Qatar Airways lounge but the miserable Miracle lounge. The flights themselves were vastly better with one exception. The seats are extremely comfortable and sleeping is relatively easy. The 777 and A350 had the Q suites. I enjoy these on the 777 but the cabin feels quite cramped on the A350. Meals were excellent but the movie selection was boring and seemed geared more to children. The one exception was departing EDI. With the cabin crew arriving late, we had to stand in line for about 25 minutes before boarding started. The three wheelchair passengers were naturally allowed priority. A few minutes later business class was boarded but with the wheelchairs  still at the end of the airbridge we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before they could be boarded. I looked forward to a hot towel and a glass of rose champagne. Quickly other passengers were being served while no FA bothered to take my coat. I finally had to ask to be served, being the last in the cabin to receive any attention.

This was not the case. When I quizzed how I could possibly have upgraded without paying, they agreed I couldn't have. A very helpful member of staff re-issued our tickets in economy after phoning reservations and after over an hour stood at checkin. No fault of his and he was a credit to the company. On board I felt the staff were efficient but never over-friendly and it was an hour and a half before we were even offered a drink.

469,2022-03-05,9,10,"""The IFE is world class""",Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2022-03-05,"  Flew 1st March 2022 on brand new aircrafts, B787-9 and A350-1000, respectively. Flights on time. Ticket purchase, upgrade by miles (2nd leg), ground services, ticket changes went smooth. I had to change a simple economy ticket 4 times. Only once I was charged additional (minimal charge). Check-in in CPH easy and quick getting all 3 boarding passes at once. This, despite I faced steep documentation requirements for final destination beyond Singapore to Papua New Guinea. Their cooperation with partner Air Niugini was perfectly coordinated and a relief. QR respect their elite members on ground as well as on board – for this trip there were no let-downs or real issues – their call centre was excellent, decisional, and cooperative. Lounge experiences: QR uses now the Eventyr Lounge in CPH which is a great improvement compared to the lounges they earlier used. Further, it is situated in non-Schengen area 3 Minutes from boarding gate. The Eventyr lounge is good, likely the best in Copenhagen - but it is still below world class. The best is the views, service, showers, and draught beer presence. Hot food only provides 1 dish while cold sandwiches are more diverse. No champagne and poor wines. They should open the balcony area to reduce greenhouse heating effect of the panorama windows which dominates the entire lounge. In Doha, the Al Mourjan Lounge is back to previous (pre-Corona) standards – lack of beer options are the biggest shortcoming. Good showers and very good relax/working options. CPH-DOH: I was given an exit seat but opted to take the only full seat section available next to the toilets so I could spread out with my things. Free WiFi for 1 hour granted, it worked well. Stewardess(es) were of high quality. Food good and are improving compared to just a few months ago. Sparkling wine (cava) offered in economy. The 2 wines were good. The new beers to replace the Heineken do not really provide improvements as they are also very dull, industrial lagers (Budwiser and Stella Artois). Arrived in Doha well pampered and in a splendid mood. DOH-SIN (night-flight) in business: Embarking in Doha at a remote gate by busses is a bad first impression for a business class ride. The Q-suites in business class are in my view completely overrated. These micro-cabins deprive passengers contact, air and view. Window access poor from those seats forward directed. If one sits backwards oriented, the window access is perfect but the direction is awkward to me. Seats and beds were excellent. The IFE is world class with updated movies, huge selection options, and the best I have ever encountered. Huge soft touch monitors. Smooth travel, reliable airline, flights on time. FAs excellent, 2 kinds: well-trained caretakers and less trained food-bringers. High class dining though without true dinner. The food was good but just “light, cold dinner snacks”. Cold lobster bites dont quite make it. Breakfast better, but merely neatly looking and served than actually tasty. Coffee and tea truly homemade and of high class. Drinks were World-class: 2 champagnes and 6 wines offered – all expensive and of high quality. Bollinger 2006 rose champagne was very tasty and sparkling one of the best I have had for long. One quality beer, Leffe Blonde, was outstanding. Pyjamas and Amenity kit given out.",Business,Economy Class,Copenhagen to Singapore via Doha,March 2022,N/A,Boeing 787-9 /  A350-1000,1

Upon my arrival in Cairo I found out that my luggage did not arrive with me. After taking quite a bit of time to file the lost luggage paperwork, I was informed that I would have to return to the airport (one hour taxi ride each way) to pick it up myself. Luckily, the suitcase arrived the next day and I had built in an extra day for sightseeing prior to the start of my tour. It took $100 and 5 hours round trip to retrieve my suitcase. I saved the receipts and submitted them to Qatar for reimbursement - and they will not reimburse me because I didn't buy anything. Apparently if I had bought clothing when I was dead tired after close to 24 hours of travel, they might have reimbursed me.  But they didn't tell me this up front. They let me go through the entire process a few times before deciding not to reimburse me.

After approximately 30 minutes we are asked to go to boarding again. After boarding was complete, the pilot made an announcement telling us that he cannot start engine number 2 and that technicians were on the way. He then proceeded to ask us to get off the plane because they needed to completely shut down and reboot the plane and that it would be very uncomfortable for us to be inside the aircraft when that was taking place. He also mentioned that it would be a lot more comfortable for us in the terminal as we would have refreshments and be able to use the facilities. And so we offboarded and onto the terminal.  In the upcoming 4 hours we waited without any information, no update given to us, no one from Qatar was at the gates or in any way present. There was an announcement saying that we will get an update in 30 minutes but that update never came. We asked the airport staff several times and we were told that the staff is on the plane fixing it and that we will get an update. No update came. There was only one shop that only accepted cash for payment.  No update about our flight or the connecting flight that we had missed (QR 0161) or about what to do next. We were ignored and the situation was mishandled. No person from QA or airport staff asked us if we needed anything or offered a glass of water or any piece of information.

My experience was at best average, and a disappointment after having such high expectations. I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews.

Not enough seats, overcrowded, no social distancing. The rude and clearly incompetent gate agent shouted at his staff and contributed to the already stressful atmosphere.

The on ground experience is perfect, with great boarding, great staff support, great call support, great privilege club benefits and so on. But in the air, I was greeted with an oldish plane and subpar seating. The seats were somehow smaller than even I've become accustomed to in recent years. The entertainment system was alright but slightly laggy, and the headphones provided were awful. The food was of acceptable quality, though the lunch provided between the two meals was subpar (it was a boring, bland roll.) The wifi is only 10 dollars but privilege club members get one hour for free. I believe students get it for free in general but I wasn't able to get that to work.

They changed to an aircraft fitted with Q suite, which is like flying first class. Due to the delay, business class cabin was quite full, but it didn't affect the high level of service. Welcome drinks, pyjama sets, toiletry bag and all. Due to the pandemic, there was no magazines or any reading materials. However, there were printed menu and wine list. Crew wear a face mask. Food was served course by course in generous portion, there was no signs of any cost cutting. Inflight wifi was fast and steady too, only cost USD10 for the entire flight. Qsuite is one of the very best business class seats in the current market. The door gives you an excellent level of privacy. Comfortable large seat with sufficient storage space and comfortable for sleeping position. Throughout the flight crew presence is good, very pro active, they always come around and see if anyone needs a drink or so. A truly wonderful 9 hours just flew by, a very smooth landing. Plane was parked on tarmac, we had to be bussed to the gate. Biz customers get their own bus. Connecting in Doha is a bliss, with security procedures simplified.

I have flown business class with Emirates and American before, but none of them come even close to what Qatar offers. To start off, Qatar is the only airline that offers on-demand dining, it feels like I am in a 5-star restaurant, the food quality and the in-flight service are always superb, the staff both ground and in-flight are well trained and very professional. I am positive the business class experience in Qatar is better than most airlines first-class service. On my last flight, I chose a lobster dish for my dinner, I can honestly say it was better than any other lobster dish I have tried in many fancy restaurants.

On the return, the check-in at Larnaca was one of the worst I have ever experienced. The was 1 business class counter and one bag drop counter. The agent on duty was expected to scan every travel document manually (although this information was in the booking already) which resulted in a minimum check-in time of 2o mins per pax and long queues. Two wheelchairs were booked for Doha; they were only aware of one. The system with the golf carts was chaotic and when questioned the staff said it was unavoidable as they were short-staffed. As we had a 7-hour layover in Doha we decided to use the ""Quiet Lounge"". The design of these cubicles is non-sensical: they contain either one uncomfortable, narrow couch plus an armchair and footstool or 2 chairs and a footstool.

When I became a member of their Student Privilege Club, I was surprised by the benefits they offered me, such as free WiFi and additional baggage. The flight from Kyiv to Montreal via Doha was my first flight with Qatar Airways, and I can say that I was satisfied (even though the journey was too long and tedious). Qatar Airways has excellent service (refreshing towels at the beginning of the flight), they offer nice food (and the good thing is the online menu so that you can make a choice before your flight). The food was tasty, and the portions are big (I think I spend half of my time aboard eating). On the 5h flight from Kyiv to Doha, they offered 2 meals + snacks, on the 12h flight from Doha to Montreal, I had 2 meals + sandwich + snacks. The seats are comfy, the legroom in the economy is okay (but for long flights, if you have money better to take a business class). In addition to the standard kit - pillow + blanket - they gave protective kits on both flights and amenity kit on a long flight (that was actually very useful for me since I always forget my eye mask and earplugs). Regarding entertainment, they offer many movies + as I mentioned there is WIFI aboard, but it was not working quite often. I had a layover in Doha for more than 10h at night. The airport is nice and easy to navigate through. But the layover was too long.

Thought I could upgrade from Economy to Business, but their Privilege Club is further degrading and has abolished that option. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to pay and book online due to increased security causing it to be a several days’ project to issue a ticket. Award tickets cannot be booked without instantly paying taxes. And, online payments could not be effected from Rwanda due to code/country problems to receive OTP. Thus, even temporarily bookings can’t be made unless done directly by QR over phone at higher fares and lots of troubles involving use of other people’s credit cards. Check-In in Kigali easy, though must be in Airport 4 hours prior to departure due to Corona prevention measures. Granted Lounge access to Pearl lounge which is acceptable. Must pay for luxury beverages. But a variety of hot food and snacks offered makes up for it. All flights on B-787-8. Long haul Economy Class QR is top notch and matches economy+ on other airlines. They have improved economy class services since I travelled with them last time; 18 months ago. FAs are attentive and extremely concerned of elite travellers like myself – I have a fainting Gold Card, but was addressed by name throughout I was given the best seats possible in economy among options provided. Drinks were offered frequently. Call bells responded to quickly. Three choices of hot food on every long leg: plenty of it, and I got more if requested. No seafood, mutton, fish or exotic meat offered. English breakfast without bacon? Salads average and desserts were excellent. Sparkling wine (Cava) and wines. Beers offered are still embarrassing: only two, similar, dull lagers offered: Stella Artois and Budweiser – Heineken has gone but that does not add to the repertoire, anyway. The leg DOH-CPH offered two meal rounds. First, a Champagne brunch (3 meal options). Then, a heavy sandwich prior to descend. I was given 3 seats through seat-block for elite travellers.

The first leg of the flight was delayed and passengers had to miss their connecting flight from Doha, so I had to wait in Doha for a full day and night. Initially, the airport staff told us no hotel would be available, but they will try to get us lounge access, and directed us to the next customer service desk. When I inquired again about lounge access, they told us no lounge is available because the airport is too busy. We gave you a meal voucher though and here is a blanket. You can rest in the Quiet Room. And that was all the service I received for 24 hours. One meal voucher and a blanket. Since airport staff was not helpful, I called the Customer Service line to ask for some form of compensation given that no accommodation was provided, and missing the connecting flight was completely the airline's fault.

The reservations system is clumsy and full of frustrating redundancies in terms of data input. You need to re-enter country of residence and nationality at payment time despite having done that already for the booking.  The problems arise when there is a bug and it becomes unavoidable to deal with a human operator. And this is where the nightmare starts. The operators, while usually courteous, are unable to do anything useful. In our case, they kept telling us there was nothing wrong with our corrupt data. In one instance, calling the Swiss desk, my call was broken and they would hang it up as we tried to call back. The Doha call center was easier to talk to, but they could not see, let alone fix the data problems. They made us believe that problems would be fixed at check-in or at the transit desk. Upon reaching the Doha stopover around midnight, we got kicked around from desk to desk (transit, to lounge, to ticketing, to upgrade before you fly. And at every stop,  ""we can't help you here, but no worries, your solution is at the next stop"". Nobody did the right thing when a system error is causing additional cost or reduced opportunity. On our previous trip, we checked-in to the Doha Al-Mourjan lounge with two paid up vouchers of which one was mysteriously not showing in their system. They treated us like suspects of having forged the voucher, it took 45 minutes of misery at 1 AM, with them absolutely refusing to let us take a rest while they investigated the bug, despite us offering them to take a debit on our credit card as a safety.

The flight from Tehran to Doha was late for about two hours. Because of the delay, I lost my next flight from Doha to Seattle. Flight delay can happen for whatever reason, and all airlines have a policy of how to handle such a situation and take care of their passenger. The problems started when we landed at Doha international airport. The Qatar airways assistance guided us to the ""ransfer desk to arrange our missed flight. The ""Transfer desk"" had us wait right behind their door for hours to assign our next flight. In my case, I had to wait for more than two hours to get my next flight boarding pass from Doha to Seattle twenty-four hours later. Unfortunately, they didn’t offer any hotel, lounge, or a voucher to get a shower. Qatar Airways accommodations for their mistake and staying in an airport for twenty-four hours were two cups of coffee, two cookies, and a dirty blanket. Later at night, I went back to the  Transfer Desk to ask if they could give me at least a blanket that they did. However, it was dirty.

During the pandemic and in times like this, they make us feel safe. They keep on ensuring all health and safety requirements are met. What stood out during my recent trip were 2 main things. When confirming my meal preference, I was greeted by “Welcome Back” and that just made me feel recognized. They know their customers well and never miss out on any meal preference requested or any detail that could make you feel comfortable. We had arrived slightly late to Doha and I didn't have much time left to catch my second flight.

We are glad that we chose Qatar Airways who made us feel safe and relieved. Transfer desk staff at Montreal were friendly and helpful in sorting out some last minute challenges on travel clearance. They gave us a meal voucher since all business class lounges were closed in Montreal airport. Boarding was streamlined to ensure social distance. Upon boarding the crew introduced and explained the cabin features. The amenity kid, COVID PPE kit, duvet were all ready at the seat and the crew offered the pyjamas. We chose the refreshing lemon mint signature drink prior to take off. The Qsuite is truly a first class business class suite with great comfort and privacy, could not ask for anything more. The couple suite rear facing was great offering us more personal space with the divider removed. The beverage and meal service was prompt and on demand. We miss the trolley service where you get to choose the options and appreciate the presentation but that is understandable during COVID times. One of the cabin crew was convincing my wife hard to have the breakfast since she skipped the dinner service. The crew wear their full PPE including gown and safety glasses and the passengers are required to wear masks at all times. The washrooms were kept clean at all times, however I felt the A350 washrooms bit smaller than the B777 ones. The transit experience in Hamad airport was smooth and refreshing. The 3 hours went by quick with shower facilities, spacious seating options and dining options on the upper level. The stand out was the consistency of care, genuinity and hospitality of the cabin crew - makes such a positive difference and validated our decision of choosing Qatar Airways especially during the challenging Covid times.

I provided records of my  72 hr pcr test and even my vaccination certificate. The staff then told me to call back for a update. To this date, after providing all the justification, I have yet to receive justification why I was not allowed to board my flight after meeting all the requirements, or help in rebooking my flight if a mistake was made.

Due to this benefit I have booked on Qatar Airways. But now when I want to change the ticket, delay my flight back to Stockholm a week or more they are asking for the fare difference which is 300-500USD.

Due to the restrictions on flying our flight got pushed back until we finally got clearance to fly one year after our initial booking and six months after our intended flight. Changing our tickets was simplicity and the person dealing with the change was very helpful. Checking in at Sydney was average with the check in staff doubling up with gate duties, there were only four flights departing Sydney that evening so they weren't exactly rushed off their feet. The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasn't as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile.

Quite unclear when the free date change applies! So I had to stick to the original travel date. Seats in A350 economy are very narrow in width and I don't want to imagine being squeezed into them in a full flight. Luckily for us passengers, both flights were only 1/3 or less full on all flights. They put all passengers in the rear part of the cabin for departure, after which you're free to roam around and pick a free row to sit or sleep, which made the trip very enjoyable.

They told me I had to contact the Malaysian embassy and obtain that before they could let me board. I was devastated as it was already close to departure time. I went and sat down and called my family in Malaysia and told them about my situation and at the sane time going online to find out what the requirement was to enter Malaysia even though I’m a Malaysian citizen. Apparently, it’s a letter that I have to sign in order to undertake to pay for my quarantine in Malaysia (which didn’t apply to me as I was going home to my state of Sarawak and Sarawak would bear all my quarantine expenses since I’m a Sarawakian). My family advised me to call my cousin’s daughter who is an immigration officer in Kuala Lumpur. I was just about to call her when one of the gate agents called me back to the podium. Apparently, one of the Qatar Airways employee working that day thought outside the box, went online to the Malaysian website and printed out that letter for me.

Given the current situation, I felt at ease as all passengers were required to wear both face masks and a face shield. Temperature checks were also require prior to boarding. Qatar Airways seems to be taking the pandemic very seriously, which is great to see, as they supplied us with spare masks, gloves and hand sanitiser, all complimentary. Frustratingly, the screens at London Heathrow stated “flight closing” when the flight hadn’t even started boarding yet, and this caused a number of passengers to panic considering the huge size of Terminal 5 and the amount of time it can take to cross the terminal to get to your gate. I was very surprised with how spacious the aircraft was. There was plenty of leg room and it was great to see Qatar Airways adhere to social distancing regulations - no two passengers were seated next to one another unless travelling as a group. The meal services provided onboard were fantastic. They had more selection than other airlines I’ve flown with in the past. Cabin crew were generally very welcoming and friendly. My connection in Doha was only 1 hour, however this was plenty of time for me and my bags to make it to the other aircraft in time. Overall a great experience - if you’re nervous about flying during the current pandemic, I would highly recommend considering Qatar Airways as their Covid-19 rules and regulations put me at ease and it was great to see them taking the safety of passengers and crew seriously.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon via Doha,October 2020,N/A,Boeing 777-300,1

Qatar Airways allowed unlimited changes to flight schedule without any extra fees or charges (with some terms). I made 3 changes to my flights and they were all done via the phone to the customer service hotline, which was accessible.  The flight attendents, food served and comfort of the flight was unparalleled. There is nothing for me to complain about. I only have nice words to say about this recent flight home to Singapore. There is no doubt that I think Qatar Airways is deserving of being the top airline.

Also tried reaching out on their facebook page but still no answer. We ended up leaving our pet behind. Upon arriving at the airport, the agent informed me that my husband's credit card should be present for verification. I told them that I had the same credit card with the same account number/credit card number because we share the same account but my card is under my name. They refused it and were about to send me back home. The supervisor informed me that an email was sent to us for credit card verification. I informed them that I did not get such an email. I contacted my husband who was in the US and he also did not get an email. I quickly searched my junk mail and found that it was sent to me the day before the flight. I sat in the airport and submitted all required documents online (luckily I had all what they required available). We waited for QA customer support to verify but they did not. They tried to call them from the airport but they did not answer and they did not even reply to the emails they were sending. The supervisor then told me that the only option left was for me to put down another payment and once they finish the credit card verification, then they'd refund me. I used the same credit card and we were on our way. At Doha airport (transit) I seemed to remember leaving behind my expensive headphones hanging on the hand of my seat. I immediately asked a QA agent to have a staff member get it for me since i was not allowed back onto the plane. The agent called the lost and found office instead and got no answer. He assured me that they'd send it for me once found. I told him that I was still here at the airport and it would be quick to just get it now, he did not seem able to help. At Los Angeles airport, they seemed to have lost one of my luggage. The agents there assured me that all luggages were transferred and were onboard and another customer has grabbed my bag. I filed a missing bag form and they called me the next day to inform me that it was found. Upon inquiring where the bag was at, the agent told me that it was left behind in Beirut airport. Once I got home, I checked my credit card and found that the two charges for our airline tickets were both cleared. I emails customer support and until this moment did not receive my refund. I had to file a dispute with my credit card and since I had all proof that I was double charged, my credit card has immediately refunded my money back.

They took her to a lounge and left her there and someone else came later to assist her to flight, no real issues. I realised while checking in on the way back to the UK that the accompanied on the ticket didn't include the return leg which I asked for and assumed with the price paid was completed.

Food and drink offering were top notch and the QSuite is possibly the best business class product available. The cabin crew were as engaging and hospitable as ever despite the limitations of working in full PPE - they really wanted to ensure we were comfortable and enjoying the flight.

However we managed to get on a UK charter flight to Manchester via Doha to Melbourne recently. This review should really cover the Manchester to Melbourne flight via Doha. We required wheelchair assistance and medical oxygen so it was not a straight forward flight. We have so many people to thank and especially Qatar Airlines which will be the subject of the review here. Customer service was excellent. Qatar Cyprus (Eleni) reached out to us to assist us. Qatar Airways waived all charges for changing the route completely. Once they approved the wheelchair and oxygen they swung into action, we had excellent assistance from Check in to boarding and then disembarking. We were told many times that they will take care of the medical needs by the cabin crew who checked on us frequently during the flight. At Doha, we were picked up and transported to the different gates effortlessly and efficiently and were allowed to stop to get some sandwiches We have nothing but the utmost praise for the cabin crew (Flights QR 28 and QR 904 11th May 2020) for looking after us. Safety due to virus From videos to cleaning the toilets frequently and wearing the appropriate safety gear, they kept us safe during the flight. It can't be easy on the cabin crew as they are exposed to passengers all the time so they are like frontline healthcare professionals. My deep respect for the cabin crews. Qatar Airways - We will get you home (catch cry at the moment). Thank you Qatar for getting us home. Whilst most major airlines abandoned us, you kept flying. You upgraded your safety levels to manage the virus and you kept flying. You are the only major airline that kept flying to Australia. You deserve an award for this.

Generous baggage allowance of 30kg per passenger. Despite the minor issues of delays at check-in at Manchester Airport and some mild chaos at boarding (not due to Qatar Airways, and more Manchester Airport ground staff), I really enjoyed my first flights with Qatar Airways. Transiting through Hamad International Airport was a breeze, despite the bus transfers and a one hour transfer layover time in Doha, but love the airport. Obviously was very much looking to the return flights, but due to cancellation due to the Coronavirus, this did not happen and flew back with Air Mauritius to London Heathrow (review to follow). The flights however will be delayed and will use them in the next 12 months on another Qatar Airways Flight, if they decline my request for a refund. In all, a great experience. Much better than Emirates for sure in terms of cost, baggage allowance and cabin service.

Great novelty factor and the flight literally flew by (no pun intended). Food and drink are amazing, and the flights were simply not long enough to get through it all between London and Adelaide. By the time you've finished playing with the seat, had a few drinks, eaten, watched the movies and slept, you've arrived-feeling raring to go. No jet lag either way and so straight into the holiday. Sat on the window seats on the way home, as the one drawback of the centre seats is no individual air vents, which meant the cabin got stuffy. In the A350 900, the second, smaller cabin is better (almost empty, very quiet) and on the A350 1000, front cabin is better, as the rear one is closer to the galley and WC.

I fly Qatar as my airline of choice when I can and have flown them many times, but this is my first review on this platform and just for one flight on one of their A380s, despite having flown on them numerous times. I choose Qatar purely because it is the one airline for me that has a benchmark of standards that are consistently applied across its cabin staff in particular and the aircraft in service. I know that if I fly a smaller A319 from Bucharest to Doha for example or an A380, 777 or A350 long haul, that the cabin crew will be just as polished and polite on each service and the aircraft turned out immaculately. I have flown Qatar in economy and Business, but I am yet to try their First Class product. I have tried the Q-Suite on the 777-ER and for me, that is better than many first-class products on other airlines so no need to try first class!! I am looking forward to flying on the A350-1000 in a few weeks time and will continue to fly Qatar where I can, for me they are the benchmark airline in the industry for onboard service. The one downside for me is their Rewards program which I think is very rigid and overly taxing in terms of reward points they charge for upgrades etc and what they give as rewards. I think they can be more generous with their Privilege Club members, as there are far better rewards programs out there, this is the one area they let themselves down.",Business,Business Class,Bucharest to Sydney via Doha,February 2020,N/A,A380,0

The entire experience is always very calm and rather luxurious, even in economy, and the flight route (between Perth and London) is exceptionally fast.

I got the impression that the booking might be cancelled, despite the fact that the money had already been taken from my account. The first time I had such an experience with any airline. I arrived at the check-in desk hours before the flight and stood waiting for over an hour and a half only when check-in began did they tell me I needed to go to the office, where they debited and repaid one pound! Fast channel security was overcrowded and took a long time (not QA's fault of course). Boarding was smooth, and then once on the plane service was magnificent. Excellent flight, very good seat. FAs were very helpful and polite throughout. Deboarding complicated, we had to wait and then board buses. I thought I had time in Doha Airport to relax but was underestimating the delay going through security a second time, and then getting to the departure gate, where there was a kind of chaos. Put on another (business class) bus.

I had complained to Qatar airways and they just say that they can change planes according to their conditions of carriage. Boarding was smooth and the flight left on time. The seating is an old business class seat. Seating comfort is very limited and I could not use it for sleeping. Entertainment is the usual movie program. Wifi was not available on this plane. Another surprise was the very limited offer of food with no main course (breakfast of Scrambled Eggs with Chicken Sausage a main course).

Their attentiveness to the children was brilliant and beyond expectation. Flights back from Bangkok and Doha to Manchester we had a stopover of 4 days in Doha were fine too. The problem was the Bangkok check in staff. If you are travelling from Bangkok make sure that you power banks have a capacity label on because Bangkok Airport security will not allow it to go through if it doesn’t have a capacity label which I learnt to my expense! Mine that I had had for 5 years was in my bag and as going through security must have fallen out of my bag so they checked it and cos it didn’t have a label they refused to let it through. I went back to check in to ask for assistance and staff could only give me advise to take it to the post office and post it to my Uk address (I did go to post office but they refused saying they can’t post batteries). The lack of attentiveness of this check in staff and then her colleague was disgusting. The issue here wasn’t the power bank but it was the sentimental value it had attached to it that can never be replaced.

The supervisor was Deyan and he was exceptional - after fixing my seat, he looked after me and my mother for the entire flight making sure we were comfortable and checking on us from time to time.

The food was excellent. What I like most about Qatar Airways is that they are very generous with the hot/cold towels (I like the hot version better). Doha airport is quite amazing (much better to my mind than Dubai). Boarding in Geneva was a breeze and the same in Doha.

The cabin looked congested and crowded. A large collection of films were in the video library including several Hollywood classics. Meal service is on demand - something I don't care for. The menu list is extensive. Pajamas, sandals, and a toiletry kit were provided on this flight. On the shorter CCU-DOH flight only a toilet kit (a ""cheaper"" version) was on the seat. The biggest surprise was that Qatar airways has discontinued its in-flight duty free shopping, something I have always enjoyed about air travel. There is really nothing to fault on this airline except that on both occasions, the flight attendants had to be reminded to bring me my jacket on arrival which they were so eager to stow away when I boarded.

I booked a connecting flight through Qatar Airways web site and they booked me from Toronto via Montreal with Porter Airline at 7 p.m. and then from Montreal to Doha at 9 p.m. and from Doha to Multan Pakistan with Qatar air flight. The nightmare started on Friday at 5pm when me and my wife arrived at the airport  2 hours before our flight but we were told Porter cancelled my original flight 7:00 p.m. and booked us an hour earlier without notifying me. Which resulted us missing our flight even though we have received the boarding passes and we were at the gate 15 mins before flights departure but according to them they can’t board our luggage (4 pieces for me and my wife at 20kg each as per allowed limit of 23KG each) as it will bring the flight over the weight limit. They promised to book us in next available flight which was at 8:00, which was again too late as out next flight was leaving Montreal at 9:00 pm. We were told we will receive a call with in 2-3 hours which never happened even though we waited all night to hear from them and we ended up missing our Montreal to Doha flight. When I tried to call Qatar's helpline, it was closed. I called Qatar head office and they told me that their system tells that we were no show, so according to their terms and conditions we have to buy new tickets which will cost $3500 for two people one way. Even though we had boarding passes and it was not our fault but they told us to take it to up with Porter. I called Porter and they told us that since we never booked with their office they can’t help us and we have to contact Qatar Airways. We stayed up all night continuously trying to get hold of someone from Qatar but to no avail. Next day we went to Porter head office and made a huge scene (whole different story) but at least after 10 hours of bickering and arguing at around 10 p.m. Saturday, they accepted their mistake and told us to go home and they contacted Qatar and got us a flight for Sunday, without any charge, whole 2 days later which with 10 hours layover in Doha to reach Pakistan.

I was flying out with my dog, a native Sri Lankan dog (breed was mixed/mongrel) and it was a nightmare to book. To be fair, it wasn't bad the first time - mixed breed was okay. Unfortunately I had to change the date of my flight and rebook my dog onto the flight, and that's where the nightmare began. The staff wanted to know what breed my dog was, despite my dog not having a breed at all. I called them on a Friday about the dog, they said I would hear from them within 48 hours. That following Wednesday I had to call them because I hadn't heard anything yet, only to find out they never processed the dog in the first place and my flight was that Sunday! Despite not having any problems with ""mixed breed"" the first time, I had loads of problems now. Mixed breed wasn't okay, despite stating it definitely wasn't one of the dogs not allowed to fly. Mongrel wasn't okay either. I eventually got approved just over a day before the flight. It was an absolute nightmare to deal with - but from others I heard that Qatar was one of the easiest airlines to deal with for pet transport, and no one had any problems so far (there have been hundreds of Sri Lankan dogs transported with Qatar before this problem). The flight itself wasn't bad. We departed Colombo on time, staff were great during check in and checking my and my dog's documents was really easy - the manager was even excited to see my dog, and her and another staff member dedicated their time to me, in my own queue. The staff on the plane were nice too, both from Colombo-Doha and Doha-Amsterdam and assured me my dog was okay, even checking with the pilot to make sure the dog was on the flight and the pilot was aware of the dog. The flight itself was comfortable, good movie selections too. The only thing that bothered me was a lack of legroom on my Doha-Amsterdam flight, because the row in front of us had 4 seats and our row had 3 seats, leaving less space for me because of the seat in front of me. Me and the dog arrived safely and they even changed the dog's bedding during the layover, so I'm happy about that.

We got QSuites though also on this route Qatar Airways offers no duty free. The staff was pleasant and the QSuites were nice, there was a selection of meals which I choose to skip as non of them seemed appealing to me and the flight was short so I limited myself to the drinks which was fine.

I am a very nervous flier and the airline and the staff make all the difference. When booking Qatar airways was very decently priced and so I thought I would give them a go. So very pleased I did. Manchester - Doha I was given seat 37A - window exit seat. Which was VERY nice of the ground staff. They didn’t have to do this but I think the man could already see at check in that I was afraid. The seat was comfortable. I’m a fairly chubby lady, however I fit into the seat great and the seat belt and person next to me all was totally fine. The flight was a little bumpy but I was kept entertained by watching the cabin staff - watching them keep calm during turbulence stops me from being so scared. I didn’t eat during the flight as I find it too hard to eat during bumpy times as it worries me even more - silly I know, but. My passenger next to me however had a pack of pretzels soon as we took off, a chicken lunch around 1 hour after take off, then about 1 hour before arrival had a chicken pastry. There were drinks served at the same time. I had a gin - to calm nerves ;). Juice, water and Pepsi. Staff lovely. Had a lady from Ghana serving mostly. Arrived on time with smooth landing. Doha airport is massive  for those who have not ever been. Very nice ground staff at the gate. Doha to Auckland was even more bumpy. Constance low level turbulence with at times the seat belt signs coming on. Again on time landing despite leaving Doha around 20/30 mins late due to long take off queue at Doha (even at 2.30am). Breakfast was served about 1 hour after take off, then dinner around 5 hours. Snack box in between, a hot pastry in between and then  breakfast around 1 hour before arrival. I actually ate the second breakfast, I had the sausage and eggs. I ate the sausage but left the eggs and potatoes as not to my taste. Also had a coffee, orange juice, croissant, bag of apple slices and yogurt. Very good indeed. The flight attendant could see I wasn’t eating due to the bumpy conditions and kindly left me the snack box while I slept under my seat which had chocolate, granola bar, juice, pretzels etc. Furthermore, the flight attendants were absolutely lovely when I pressed the buzzer multiple times asking for water - again due to being afraid of flying I don’t like to stand up on flights. The cabin crew came around with boxes of popcorn / crisps during the flight as ‘movie snacks’. Such a nice touch!! Although i didn’t eat, the people next to me said the food was delicious. I can’t watch the tv whilst on the flight as I wear pressurising EarPods (I can’t hear anything at all). But the films were great; they had new films like dumbo live action & avengers endgame. Loads of games which I did play. As well as 1 hour free WiFi or WiFi for the whole flight for $10. Great connection much better than Emirates. For Emirates connection usually I can only access iMessage. However with Qatar I was able to go on Facebook, Snapchat and instagram with no issues at all. Probably on my flight home I will pay the $10 for my whole flight as it puts me at ease being able to talk to family and friends. Nice toiletries bag on the long flight with toothbrush, socks, eye mask, toothpaste and lip balm. The flight from U.K. to doha was 7 hrs while to Auckland was just over 16 hours. Which is VERY long and hard especially for a very very nervous flier.

IFE was very well equipped and the screens were surprisingly responsive - it was hardly impossible to get bored throughout the journey.

The food comes direct to you from the galley - no rattling trolley service so if other people want to sleep, you can eat and not disturb your fellow travellers. The food was always excellent in heat and presentation. With this system you can order as much or as little as you want. If you do not wish to sleep, on the A380 at the back of business class there is The Bar which serves mocktails, cocktails and Champagne, juice and snacks There a sofa with seatbelts for sitting and magazines if you wish to read.

However do to pricing factors for a business class ticket, I transferred my amazing American Express membership reward points to my QA account and credited it with miles. After having done that I called up the call centre who said there weren't any seats available for miles. I was disappointed as  I had already transferred my amex points out by then. As my date of travel arrived, departed Muscat to Doha on economy I had a 2.5 hr transit in doha and felt like trying my luck at the customer service counter.  Unfortunately my hope for an upgrade via miles was not entertained by the lady stating I was not eligible. Not giving up i was directed by another  staff to head to the counter where the security checks were. One staff typed away on his system started making calls and told me theres just one seat available which only could be released after confirmation from his team which would just one hour prior to departure. Keeping my fingers crossed 10 minutes later he told me I was able to avail the upgrade! The efforts made by Ahmed were so remarkable that I insisted I raise this to the management that staff like this should be admired and rewarded for such excellent service and should be role models. The gesture made such a difference to the whole trip as the Qsuite on the A350 is an amazing experience and I think it's a better than even the A380 business having the double bed feel side by side to your partner is wonderful.

Our first 6 hours flight to Doha was crowded, only 2 toilets for more than 150 people, the corridor was full all the time from people queuing to go to the toilet.  In previous opportunities, staff were more careful about this situation. Food the worse quality I got in a long flight, a chicken sandwich indian style and a breakfast plate with very weird eggs. Again, my experience in the past was way better. Doha to Singapore: Seats were comfortable, bigger plane, good entertainment, on time. Staff not service oriented, very bad faces when asking for water. Again that sandwich and breakfast plate with eggs. At this time me and my husband decided to avoid the food. As soon as we arrived in SG, we had digestive problems. I wrote to the airline, part of their answer was: ""We would like to take this opportunity to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience which may have been caused to you. While no reports similar in nature have been received from passengers who were served the same meal on the flight, we take reports such as yours with serious concern.""

Inflight entertainment might be bit better, especially on A330 equipment where screens are old. I noticed the A330 had fewer lavatories. But what is absolutely the best when it comes to Qatar Airways are the meals and drinks. You have an outstanding choice of three main courses. Cold drinks served twice on ARN-DOH leg. And hot drinks also twice. Ability to select seats for free or ask (if you have a very short connection in Doha for example, to chose a front aisle seat). Boarding procedures were easy and simple. Both flights were on time and it is the most important thing.

884,2019-07-27,10,10,"""the best of the best""",K Lee,Thailand,2019-07-27," I do not regret choosing Qatar Airways at all. Almost everything was the best of the best! I was also lucky enough to be able to fly Qsuite, which is easily the best way to travel. Check in at Bangkok Airport is quite a mess, due to the fact that there are four flights leaving simultaneously to Doha. The check in agent said that the Qatar Airways lounge in Bangkok is closed due to a cracked window. I was about to head to the JAL lounge when I noticed that the Qatar lounge was in fact, open and fully operational. This lounge was absolutely immaculate. They even had Bollinger champagne! There was a buffet service and most drinks were actually made on request to the staff. They were there to help you with everything. I think the staff to passenger ratio was 1:1. My favourite thing at this lounge has to be the Baklava. Qatar also has their lounge literally next door to their main competition, Singapore Airlines. Boarding was orderly on the outbound flights from Bangkok to Doha and Johannesburg, but on the return they instead asked economy passengers to board first, their reason being ""The cabin was not ready for business class passengers."" The good bits: Qsuite! We were a family of four, so we elected to have the first ""Quad"" seat which is essentially a conference room with closed doors! We were in our own private world up there. The seat/bed was super comfortable, although watch out for row two, as this row has slightly less foot space due to the angle of the cabin. There was a thin mattress cover provided and my mum and dad were even able to sleep together in the double bed! The regular 1-2-1 business class found on the A350 and B787 was also excellent. I would strongly suggest reserving row 7 on the A350, as you get two extra cubbies next to you for your belongings. Also located close but not too close to the toilets. The flat bed on these seats were also excellent, and there were endless seat adjustments. the ""bar"" on these planes was filled with snacks, fruit and champagne and most of the time there was a flight attendant waiting there to assist you. The service: I cannot emphasise this more, it surpassed all expectations I had set. Every single item was placed at your seat, no trays were used at all. The flight attendants were all friendly and professional. They seem to know the types of passengers very well and how to treat them. I had a cold on my return trip, and was constantly looked after. On one of the flights, a medical emergency was declared and the crew handled the situation very calmly and professionally. Once the flight landed there was already an ambulance waiting for the sick passenger. The food: Everything I tasted was excellent, and I took advantage of their dine on demand service by ordering a hot snack in the middle of the flight. I think my favourite meal was a Philly Cheesesteak which was very filling and the beef was very tender. They give every passenger (Including economy) 1 hour free wifi onboard! The Al Mourjan lounge in Doha: To call it huge is an understatement. This lounge is absolutely gigantic! You also had a personal tablet at every seat for information on the airport or flight information. Too bad everything is too spaced out. Given the fact that all airlines have their ups and downs, I would say that Qatar is an excellent airline and it shows in almost every way. I would certainly choose them because of their extensive network, but they haven't won me completely over. Yet I'd give them a 11 if i could!",Family Leisure,Business Class,Bangkok to Johannesburg via Doha,July 2019,N/A,"Boeing 777-300ER, A350-900, Boeing 787-8",1

Quickly from a side door appeared a chap arranging his tie and who welcomed me, taking my boarding pass and scanning it. I soon realised the first person to greet me was a lounge attendant and was perhaps a little embarrassed that the reception chap was not ready. I enjoyed the breakfast and relaxed for a while until boarding was ready. I was welcomed and shown to my seat where the crew offered to put my bag in the overhead locker. I was then left for a few minutes to settle in before crew returned and offered a welcome drink. As it was a holiday, at 07.30 i went for Champagne! Menu was then Brought around before a short time later crew came and discussed when would like to eat. Qatar offer dine on demand so you eat when you want but they check with you your initial intentions which i think is great. Departure from LHR was delayed which meant an very quick connection in Doha where the flight was boarding when i arrived. DOH is smooth. On arrival there was a lady calling out for Bangkok who duly wrote the gate number on my boarding pass and advised to proceed to the gate. Doha to Bangkok was a late flight so i slept and arrived in to BKK fresh. My return to LHR was two weeks or so later. BKK was again a day flight. I would say they need more staff at check in at Suvarnabhumi. There were 2 counters business class side but that also included economy bag drop. There were 2 couples ahead of me and a queue for bag drop but business class trumped the bag drop people which was a respectable touch. It took about 15 minutes compared to LHR 5 mins. Again service on QSuite was great. Drink, menu, chocolates. Staff friendly and will chat. I often feel crew just go through then motions but actually on Qatar if you engage them they will happily chat. I spoke to some about where they were from, being based in Doha, stopover etc. It seems most only have about 24 hours once they arrive where they land - greulling. Flight from DOH to LHR was lacklustre. Boarding was chaotic. everyone moves forward, economy class not listening to their instructions to wait for their zone to be called. Initially only one staff scanning boarding passes who had to keep shouting Business class passengers only. Anyway once on board it started well. Drink brought, towel, menu.

I had anticipated a quick bite to eat before getting a sleep in as i had to drive home on arrival -2 hours. We took off at 15.50 and i had'nt finished eating over halfway through the flight. Wine and nuts came - great i thought. It took 20 minutes for the amouse bouche to follow. Then when he came to clear I thought the soup would follow shortly. I was wrong.

It is common to have your passport checked at the boarding gate but not to be asked Where are you going, why are you going there, are you coming back, when are you coming back, who are you travelling with, are you a Qatar resident, can you show me your Qatar ID? This is not normal. When I asked I was told ""Sir I am just doing my job"". I am asking why I was having additional security screening and i was told it was because I checked in online. I was told I was asked all those security questions and held up at the boarding gate because I choose to check in online and print out my boarding pass at home rather than standing in line at the check in counter and having my boarding pass printed there. I know they check passports at the gate, that was not my question, I wanted to know why i was asked all those questions at the gate. That just only happens when you have been selected for Secondary Security Screening. But he refused to say that and instead of offering even a half-hearted apology. They did not open priority boarding for me a Silver member and my 6 year-old daughter. But never addressed that after i complained.

Starting from the short 50 minute KWI—>DOH Flight, it was great! Good and comfortable aircraft, screens were a bit outdated on the A330, but still has the latest oryx one movies. the legroom was fantastic, however window seats only have an IFE Box under each seat blocking legroom. Service on that short flight was great! Cabin crew were very nice, beautiful deep blue mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere Inside the cabin, and the flight was On-Time. Connection In Doha was super easy, smooth and efficient, beautiful super modern airport with great toilets,  range of shops and restaurants, and very nice staff. Boarding Started few minutes after the landing from Kuwait, so we rushed to our next flight to Munich.  Second flight  was operated on a new  and very comfortable Boeing B777-300ER, as much as people complained about the 10 abreast 777, I found it to be actually good! Legroom was amazing, Seat recline was excellent! NO IFE box under the seat blocking legroom on the B777. On demand high resolution screens, beautiful mood lighting, with nice refreshing towels being distributed. What Impressed me the most Is the Qatar Airways New Super WiFi!  I was told that it was the fastest and best In the Air. Even a YouTube video would be played. And  WiFi Is  cheap on Qatar Airways! 30 Minutes for free, and only 10USD for the duration of the flight, no matter how long. The OryxOne Inflight Entertainment System was excellent and offered a lot of great movies and TV Shows! After departure the snack service commenced, they served a Quisine savory snack sandwiches, it was very good, much better snacks then what they used to serve before. It was a good chicken pizza sandwich, not the dry chicken sandwiches they used to serve. Since It was a night flight,  Cabin lights were dimmed Into mood lighting which created a beautiful atmosphere onboard, the crew kept serving beverages every 30 minutes, they were very nice and helpful. Few hours later , they served breakfast, I ordered a special Hindu Meal request, It was delicious, at least better than the normal meal they serve. ;) That wasn’t my first time flying Qatar Airways, but I really have to say Qatar Airways has Improved a lot since my last flight with them almost 9 months ago.

At check-in we were informed that our seats had been re-assigned and there were no bassinets available and to speak to the manager on the help desk.

We called the Qatar reservations while waiting at the counter and were informed that our confirmed seat in the system was a bassinet and they shouldn't have been re-allocated. They said they would be able to provide an upgrade to business but the phone was passed to the team in Melbourne and they dismissed his request to assist us.

The flight from LHR was delayed slightly with a short layover of only 45 minutes. We were assured that everything would be done to get us there with enough time. We arrived in Doha with 35 mins to spare and waited to disembark for about 15 mins. During this time the business and first passengers were called to leave to transfer on.

Unfortunately my last trip to Australia was absolutely awful. Delays leaving London meant a night spent in Doha but the way back was worse.  I arrived in Sydney airport with 3hrs to spare before the last night flight. There were already about 100 people waiting. Then the flight coming in was announced as cancelled. After much confusion and waiting about 20 minutes it was then changed to our flight. It turned out the incoming had been diverted to Perth with a fault to the toilet and remained in Perth because it would have been to late to arrive in Sydney. This was information not shared with us by Qatar. They sent out one person to try and talk to all passengers and most people couldn’t hear him. He was getting very cross that he had to keep repeating himself. We then had to queue up to be told which hotel we were in - either the airport hotel or one back in the city centre. We queued for about and hour and a half as there were only a few people behind the counters to deal with the entire flight. They did supply a bottle of water/juice and some crackers. I was put in the city centre hotel and told to wait for a phone call or email telling me which flight I was to be put on. I endured a fairly sleepless night, waiting for the update from Qatar. In the end it was only by checking my app at breakfast that I discovered I was booked on a different airline which would take me via China and take over 30 hrs to get home. As you can imagine, I wasn’t best pleased by this and when someone then phoned me (about 30 mins later), I pleaded with them to get me a different route but they weren’t very sympathetic. I cadged a lift with a couple flying to Scotland who had managed to get on a flight with Qatar and went to the Qatar office to plead with them without luck. They did give me a food voucher and told me to go to the counter when the lunch time flight was leaving in the hope that some people had cancelled and I could get on, again with no luck. I remained airport side for most of the day trying to plead  to get me home earlier and quicker. At no point was I offered a different airport, e.g. Gatwick. To be fair the flights into London were very busy and I think this was the main issue with people going to the UK. I had to come back via China Southern Airlines and it was the worst experience I have had. I arrived home late Sunday evening and didn’t work the following day as I was exhausted.

This time I decided to take my family with a short stop over via Doha in order to save SGD3000 versus direct flight. We are a family of 4 travelling together on the way to Paris and returning on separate dates from London. I had to make three separate bookings as a consequence. I realised after making the booking it was not possible to fly together (as 3 bookings) and had to insist at the airport to be seated together. When checking online I was offered to pay 1200SGD extra for Business class upgrade which I did. I then realised the upgrade was only for one leg of the flight (Doha to Paris) and not for the entire journey. Then impossible to cancel online or by phone or to go back to the original booking and impossible to pay for the upgrade for the whole family - not available. Also cannot get a refund for the upgrade that is non refundable. The plane was slightly delayed with no explanation.

Security identified an issue with my hand luggage and made me unpack everything.

On board the A380 I have to say things took a big turn for the better, seats were comfortable, no metal boxes under the seats, I got the right meal and managed some sleep.

Service on the both legs outstanding as always. Unfortunately, my baggage didn’t make it to Stockholm, and I was promised to have it delivered to my home within a day. That’s where the nightmare started. I had a connecting flight to Hamburg, and was informed a day later that they were not willing to deliver to my home. I have to collect the baggage from Hamburg airport. Since it’s a long way from my home to Hamburg, I have not been able to collect the bag yet and it’s day 5 after arrival. I think the airlines should take full responsibility if baggage is lost. No response to my emails....the same applies to phone calls...where I was told that reservation got nothing to do with it. The handling agent insists that I collect the baggage myself.

925,2019-05-08,9,10,"""On board service was excellent""",C Down,United Kingdom,2019-05-08,"  Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don’t like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It’s not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue. Overall flight was excellent although very slight downgrades in quality, and price increases are making this not quite as appealing for leisure travellers.

926,2019-05-08,9,10,"""the best we have ever had in economy class""",Alan Stone,Australia,2019-05-08," Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years.

When I flew LHR to JNB via DOH everything was great. The brilliant service, plenty of food, great entertainment system and nice aircraft. The way back was not as good. The check-in assistant at JNB was incredibly rude as he spoke to his colleague the whole time he was checking me in and looked at me in a contemptuous way. I suspect he might be employed by the airport as I had the same experience at passport control and security. The route JNB - DOH was ok. The plane was nice and spacious and the seats were very comfortable. A female passenger moved next to me because the passenger behind her had placed her bare feet in full view on the first passenger's armrest. No one told her to put her feet away. They ran out of beef and chicken dishes and only had vegetarian left which I refused to eat as it was dal and spinach which seemed like a bad choice for a flight. The attendants tried really hard to find alternatives and credit to them for their efforts and professionalism. The airline needs to review its meal quotas for each flight. The route DOH - LGW was cramped and uncomfortable - the seats didn't go back as far. The snack was a choice of pizza or pizza with chicken. I don't eat cheese but luckily a member of the cabin crew found me something else. Staff were also great on this flight. The onboard WIFI is terrible. On two separate flights I signed up for the one hour free. The WIFI wouldn't connect until the hour was up, at which point it told me free WIFI was no longer an option. On the other two flights it worked ok but had periods where it wouldn't connect. Compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways staff are friendlier and more obliging and they give you more food.  If all Qatar Airway's planes were as good as the JNB-DOH route and they didn't run out of food then they would definitely be my favourite airline.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Johannesburg to London via Doha,May 2019,no,,1

The flight from Stockholm to Doha was top notch service wise, but the flight to Singapore was a different matter. The Qsuite was great as always, but service wasn’t. The Purser in charge never introduced herself or said goodbye, nothing. The lady in charge of my section was obviously hating her job. No smile, very slow and chaotic service, wine was served after the main course. My seat could not move 2h before arrival and I had to sit on the bed for breakfast. When the plane started to descend, I was still sitting and my third reminder to look at the seat was ignored by her. I asked someone else and within 5 minutes I was given another seat for landing.

On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard.

I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles.  The  inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage.  The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options.  A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused.

The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable. QR offered pajamas and turn down service, a first class perk. Cabin service and food were excellent, and meals were presented nicely, a la carte and on demand.

Entrance into the plane to the business class cabin was through a dedicated jet bridge. A menu card of meal choices and liquor provided along with a basic amenities bag. Cabin is spacious and seats lie flat. Only two of the five items I selected from the duty free catalog were available - the flight attendant advised that sales on routes to destinations in South Asia were generally minimal and hence small inventory on board. But more amazing to me was that to pay, I had to provide one of those old style credit cards where the name and numbers are embossed as the attendant had no electronic card reader. She took out a mechanical contraption, placed my card on it and over it a multiple sheets credit card slip and then pulled a slide over them to get the imprint. She wrote by hand the amount of purchase and my name on the slip.

These flights at Doha were at remote locations using busses which is inconvinient and time consuming, with departures using the bus gates totally unorganized.

The seats look old and very outdated. I would rate this business class experience one of the poorest I have experienced in recent years. There is zero privacy, almost no storage space. To make matters worse - when I boarded the aircraft and saw this business class cabin I told the cabin chief that I expected QSuites and he began arguing that this flight doesn’t have QSuites - a few minutes later I was told that this was a mistake and that the aircraft was changed.

Overall a pleasant experience across the four sectors flown with only one delay of less than 30 minutes due to a passenger feeling unwell. The BHX-DOH sectors were on a B787, which was probably starting to show its age. For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices. For the price I paid I was very happy with the service provided and would definitely use Qatar Airways again.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Birmingham to Manila via Doha,February 2019,N/A,,1

Yet again the cabin crew make all the difference. Unfortunately a delay at Doha due to the late arrival of the aircraft, but had the usual 1x2x1 layout with no Q suite.

I must say i was very happy with the service I got during both flights. The crew was very professional and they always went an extra mile to accommodate the needs of our child.

QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned.  We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for.

1007,2018-12-29,1,10,"""wanted to change the date""",Mohamed Tadkar,Qatar,2018-12-29,"  Washington to Doha. I had an award ticket and wanted to change the date on my return. I have modified my ticket in the past during previous holidays and it was a relatively easy process usually completed with a single phone call to Qatar Airways customer service. I called Qatar Airways and the representative informed me that I should contact the Privilege Club department, as Qatar Airways does not deal with award tickets. I called the Privilege Club department which informed me that I need to submit my request using their online contact center. If this wasn’t already a convoluted process, the automatic response to my request from the contact center was that I had to wait 3 business days before my request could be tended to. How is this practical when a customer needs to make an urgent change? My request was simple - I just wanted to know what dates were available for me to change my return ticket to and what the cost of implementing such a change would be. The response I finally received three business days later, was a generic one that did not even address my request. They replied stating that a change would cost $25 if completed 24 hours or more prior to departure and $100 if within 3 and 24 hours of departure. However, they did not provide me with any answer as to what dates were available for me to change my award ticket to. Not only did I have to wait for 3 business days to receive a response, but the response I received was completely unhelpful and useless. Having to wait 3 business days to get a response is unreasonable, especially when the responses are not helpful. My case was an urgent one and could not wait a week, let alone three business days.  attempted to contact someone from the Privilege Department on Friday and was told that my request would be expedited. I tried to follow up the next day but because it was a Saturday, the offices were closed. I tried to call on Sunday and was informed that the office was closed. What is the point of being a privilege club member if the customer helpline is not open on Saturdays and Sundays while the general Qatar Airways customer service helpline is?

The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices.

Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color. Arrival was at Terminal 8 at JFK which is very good compared to the other terminals - in terms of space, facilities, and quickness of official services.

Unfortunately, there were some problems at the gate for the flight to Boston in the Doha airport, such as a seat reassignment due to a supposed change in aircraft (which does not seem to have occurred after all), boarding which was delayed by about 40 minutes (which led to a departure which was 40 minutes late, too), and a staff member in charge of boarding who appears to have been angry at some passengers for not showing up only when their zone was called, despite her not audibly calling anyone up for boarding after the initial invitation for business class and special assistance passengers! The cabin crew for this particular flight were outstanding and made up for the issues with the ground staff! This particular flight featured quite possibly the worst turbulence I have ever endured in my life--and I once flew through a typhoon. The flight attendants managed to serve us meals during one of the bumpiest parts of the flight and did not drop or spill anything. They continued to smile and politely ask passengers if they needed anything else. One even offered me a special meal which another passenger had not shown up for!  I am a big fan of Qatar Airways--so much so that I endure 8 hour long layovers in Doha every time I fly with them, just because the experience is wonderful every time. The food is delicious, creative, and plentiful. It's also often the cheapest ticket! This time for example, my round trip ticket was for less than $900!

Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for £590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was “you cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flight”. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening.  When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again.  I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been ‘we are very sorry about this’ but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation.

I had to make an international call to Qatar’s customer service in Doha as their local office has limited service hours. Found out that 1 of the connecting flights from Casablanca to Hong Kong got cancelled. Qatar refused to compensate for the loss. I had no choice but to cut short my vacation. On the return from Casablanca to Hong Kong, it happened to hit the worst typhoon in Hong Kong, so I ended up stuck in Doha airport for 17 hours while they keep delaying the flight time. There was no support at the airport, just told the passengers to wait for a while longer and asked people to go from one service counter to another for information. When they finally decided to delay the flight for another 8 hours, it was another 1.5 hour wait for them to arrange hotel accommodation. I spent 8 hours waiting at Doha airport from 5am until 1pm. They explained there were over 300 passengers waiting and that’s why it’s taken longer to arrange hotel. But that could be avoided if they announced cancellation of the flight earlier.",Family Leisure,Economy Class,Doha to Casablanca,September 2018,no,,1

Went to the office in HK and they forced me to take 500HKD (54EUROS) for my bag, otherwise I needed to wait 2 weeks to get the money back in France.

This was the first time my wife and I had flown with Qatar Airways and my first international flight from Canberra. The B777 from Canberra are now the “Suites” version - as impressive as many reviewers have already reported and the onboard service - personal attention, food, beverage (see further comment below), in flight entertainment, ambience and comfort - as many have already stated is unmatched. My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse; there is ample time to get to the QANTAS BC lounge ard have lunch if so desired. The 15 hour flight post SYD had only one low point from Qatar’s otherwise outstanding point of view, despite the glossy wine and beverage menu (two champagnes, three whites, three reds with a “stickey” and a port plus beers, spirits and soft drinks) within four hours, and still over Australia, the whites had been exhausted.

It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check.

Having said that, it is not perfect. there are rooms for improvement in my opinion; the toilet could be cleaned more often, the content of the inflight entertainment system could be added more and be more consistent in all route (some route/aircraft type has better and more responsive screen than others), and i do hope some time in the future the fare could be cheaper because they are in the upper range of price.",Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Jakarta to Amsterdam via Doha,May 2018,N/A,,1

No smile from staff when boarding and most staff I saw did not seem very happy or friendly., some were okay.

The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.",Business,Business Class,Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha,May 2018,N/A,Boeing 777 / 787,1

Travelling with my partner and a toddler the seat was wide enough for my son to sleep beside me which was a huge bonus. Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from.

The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation.

Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha.

Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn’t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn’t too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good!

The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight.

On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard.

This happened to me again from Goa to Doha, again the cabin crew was apologetic and and showed empathy. From Doha to Manchester, luckily I was seated near the front and therefore had choice of food, and they provided numerous drinks run throughout the flight. I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food.

The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control.

But still, they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth.

It is a nice thing, but it means that people eat in different times, hence the flight attendants run up and down the cabin during the whole flight and smell of food is always present in the cabin.

1170,2018-03-20,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Hugh Colton,United States,2018-03-20,"  Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha.  Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld  members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft.  My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic.

Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable, even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated, they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted check-in for Qatar Airways: they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram, as strictly as for any low-cost carrier.

After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn’t complete torture. It’s up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I’d say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don’t have access to the regular business class lounge but  a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn’t matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it’s open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it’s economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I’ll be seeking out again.

The lounge experience in Doha was again, exemplary. The staff are so friendly and the waiter service and a la carte menu impressive. Boarding for the BKK sector was a bit of a scrum, they could make the priority lane more prominent. It was literally a case of pushing through passengers trying to board.

The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD.

First I need to tell about my bad experience with other airlines then only you will understand my wonderful experience with Qatar Airways. We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they don’t know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized it’s impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we don’t have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I don’t have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but don’t have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and don’t know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny.  Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me.

I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding.

The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world.

Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don’t they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been ½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP.

Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud.

1224,2017-12-18,10,10,"""become my airline of choice""",J Gallian,United States,2017-12-18,"  Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar’s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don’t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone. Qatar has become my airline of choice for international travel.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,Doha to Philadelphia,December 2017,N/A,A350,1

Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew’s attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there’s less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,Manila to Doha,December 2017,N/A,Boeing 777-300,1

The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you’re considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid.

However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed. Around lunchtime, another passenger I spoke to advised me to check under manage booking on the website; when I did, to my surprise I found I had been booked on a flight via Beijing in less than an hour, and never told. By the time we got to check in, we'd missed that. There were no Qatar staff at the airport, but eventually we did get through to a call centre, and finally got rerouted on Qantas to London. Qatar has made no effort to contact us since - I'd hope they'd at least refund what we spent on phone calls.

It would have been good, as part of the online check-in, if the users reminded to specify the meal preferences, etc. I forgot to specify the meal preferences but thankfully the crew had enough of what I wanted. Seats were the worst part - poor legroom.  ATL to DOH leg was the worst (and the longest leg of the trip), comfort wise, I would rate as the worst. Luckily on the return leg (DOH-ATL) next two seats to mine was empty, so was able to stretch and sleep well. DOH-MAA vv seating was little better, think its a older plane; newer planes have worst seats. Food was ok dinner and lunch but minimalistic.

You are immediately overwhelmed by the luxury this new suite has to offer. We fly as a couple and when we were seated they lowered the blind in between the two seats so you immediately felt that you had your own private compartment. We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane. The seats have many modification possibilities, even a real double bed feature. My wife fell in love with the blankets who were especially designed for this new q-suite, they feel so nice. The in-flight entertainment set provides a very big bright screen and the latest hollywood blockbusters available. The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most. It was no problem to switch the desert and main course since it looked more appetising to me. The food was really good.

We are Gold Privilege members (only relevant for the lack of care shown for a frequent business class traveller). On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm; a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices; both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight; again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily; however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved; much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience; it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.

Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on  A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present.

I had to stay an extra night in Male due to this delay it made sense to me that Qatar Airways will pay the additional cost.

I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it’s at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it’s before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn’t make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said ‘ok’ and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I’ve asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more.  She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then!  I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I’ve spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I’ve got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time.

Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented.

I was very disappointed. All throughout the flight I was worried that if my luggage didn't come with me what I would wear. The flight was very smooth. The cabin service was great. Food was excellent.

Arrived at the check-in counter only to find it not open despite it being 3 hours before the departure time. Following check-in which offered no hint of a problem, I proceeded to the lounge first and then the gate close to the scheduled departure time. At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned.

The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice.

He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and  overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional.  On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok.

After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for.

The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles.

Food taste is ok, not that great but ok for airline food. For the Doha to Paris flight, the plane used was the A380 which is my favorite plane due to the comfort it gives to the passenger aside from being very quiet. This is where one flight attendant was a bit of a let down because she wasn't that accommodating and she speaks like she is a bit grumpy. Also, the food that I want (chicken) was short on stock so I chose fish which turned out ok. Overall, I still recommend Qatar Airways if you're coming from Southeast Asia or even East Asia going to Europe.

On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft.

I am a Platinum Privilege Club member with well over 2000 Points - which means I fly on Qatar a lot, usually at least 20-30 sectors a year, sometimes more. I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again.

Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad.

The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787.

No greetings from crew when boarded. The A321 is full and it would be better, if they deploy a bigger aircraft. The flight attendants were just doing their job and not smiling. Refreshing towel pack handed out and menus were given. Drinks served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served out of Amritsar was not up to 5 star mark and very average dinner. Veg Biryani with one small teaspoon of lentils and tasted bland. Desert of Mango Kheer tasted better. The main course is small. No tea or coffee served after the meal and you have to ask for this. Inflight entertainment was good. But the touch screen option takes longer time to do the action assigned. The good thing about this flight is that it departed 10 minutes before time and reached 20 minutes ahead of its scheduled arrival time. On reaching Doha, bussed to the arrival hall which is just 5 minutes ride. As there is no other flight arrival quickly pass through security for transits and then straight to departure hall. Flight to Dubai on A321 was comfortable. Flight attendants were smiling, attentive and doing their job with passion. Considering it a 5 star airline, no water or welcome drink was served, but a hot snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight.

This last flight was on seat 2A (Dammam-Doha, A330-200) and 2K (Doha-Manila-Doha, B777-300ER) and 2A (Doha-Dammam, A320).  Cabin crew make extra efforts to provide passenger's needs anytime. Food options are very good. One note however, I still prefer the Armani amenity kit of the past rather than the latest one.

It was a race against time. Upon deplaning, to the luggage belt and me up to the check in counter for our flight to Doha on Qatar Airways. When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well. When I try to look back, I gave ourselves allowance of almost three hours for our flight to Manila. Should Iberia did not bump us off, all should've gone smoothly as planned. I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this. I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable. To the QR check in staff who assisted us, I was not able to get your name at that time but I would always be thankful for making it possible for us to get on our flight.

Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg. I find it exasperating as my partner and I were traveling together yet we were situated in seats far from each other. What's the point of pre-selecting seats? Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers.

Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat.

Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered.

Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced. None of this is tragic and I very much realize the ""Let them eat cake"" aspect of such criticism.",Solo Leisure,Business Class,DOH to JFK,March 2017,N/A,Boeing 777,

The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don’t mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard, despite business class was full. Good food, excellent wines, poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the “Educate a Child” charity.

They respond within an hour, and if they don't, they apologise. During check in, it was chaotic and took me an hour. I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic.  Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy.  She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me.

Frequent flyers are seated on the upper desk, and usually may be assigned their favorite seat number, if they ask for it. Overall, flying the A380 with QR is an excellent experience.

I will overfly my destination and give myself a layover in Doha because they are were so good. I arrived with my 11 year old son very early for check in Madrid. So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s. Having flown no airline but Qatar Airways for the last 7-8 years occasionally overflying my destination and having long layovers in one of the nicest airports in the world this will no longer be the case as matter of course. There are choices. When I become a burden of inconvenience for my loyalty as a customer then something happened to the overall picture. The flight was OK. Night flight nothing special other than the fasten seat belts sign was illuminated for the duration of the meal service and collection of trays, with no Turbulence.  I look forward to returning to the best standards achievable in my next flight. The numerical assessment reflects my belief this was a one off by people / individuals having a bad day and professional people rectifying the issues after much deliberation. Hence still recommended.

Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options; a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies; good blanket; good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours.

From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest.

However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes).

But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top. The seats on the Boeing 777 fleet are a bit old and when compared to their Boeing 787, A380 and A350.

Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious.

I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing. I really enjoyed the omelette and chicken sausage on Flight 579 from Delhi to Doha - the omelette, the sausage and the mushrooms were tender, succulent and full of flavours, but the same dish on QR29 from Doha to Edinburgh was oddly very dry, tough and obviously overcooked. The in-flight entertainment was good - there were 35 new movies to choose from, on top of other older movies. They claimed to offer WiFi on board, but I could not connect to it, or even when I was connected, it was not usable (not even to browse the web).

Two years ago I was able to drink Pol Roger Rosé Vintage 2006 and now it is Lanson Rosé. Same changes in the variety of food and drinks in the Biz lounge in Doha.

Another change is the frequency of time changes with Qatar now: My first leg of this trip was changed 4 times back and forward, last time about two weeks before departure date.

The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived.

I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge.

My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none.

The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard. Overall the experience was not bad, but t was just not particularly great.",Business,Business Class,JFK to MCT via DOH,October 2016,N/A,A350,

It started off quite badly for me when they asked for credit card verification, then kept asking for more. In the air, service and comfort was quite good, and the economy class food was quite good. Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs. I got it for the last flight and it was what you'd expect from business class. I also couldn't get the wifi to work on any flight.

The only negative that I can think of for this flight is that it was much too short. Check-in service at the business class counter was immediate, efficient, and friendly. Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music.

Long stay-overs, long time lounge access, and potential immigration issues were sorted out smoothly by Qatar Airways ground staff. First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free “hotel rooms” inside the lounge. Last leg DOH-CMB was operated by Sri Lankan who also did well (see my other review for the Sri Lankan leg). Qatar Airways takes particularly good care of their elite frequent flyers.

They quoted me a fee of about $130 to change my departure date and said we did ""not have to pay for a second ticket"". The lady on the phone confirmed that my return flight did not need changing. I agreed to the payment. A few days later our credit card bill showed a huge deduction. It has taken me 2 months of emails to get 2 replies from Qatar Airways. The replies make little sense.

The daily Boeing 777 service from Perth to Doha is excellent and we prefer to fly the Boeing 777 when we can. We enjoyed the A330-200 service from Doha to Barcelona and return, then had our first crack at the A350 from Doha to Singapore. First thing to say is the service is consistently excellent in Business Class with Qatar, and we would love it if Qantas was aligned with Qatar, which is our airline of choice over Emirates, even though this costs us in terms of status credits and frequent flier points. Qatar is a step ahead of Emirates, but QF frequent fliers are penalised if they choose QR. We were not overly impressed with the A350, especially with no independent air vent (something shared with their 787) and we find it a little warm on our flight. We also had a small problem in our seats in the A350 with the divider being stuck in the up position which meant my wife and I were separated to an extent we would normally not experience. Generally, the Qatar Airways experience is outstanding, including the lounge in Doha, although the restaurant in the business lounge no longer offers an a la carte service which is a disappointment.

The flight attendants had forgotten that I had requested a vegetarian meal, (fortunately there was a vegetarian option on the regular menu) and they kept waking people up for the meal service even though our flight left Shanghai at midnight. The saving grace was the amenity bag. However, when we boarded our flight to Madrid, it was like two completely different airlines.

Despite this, it was still very comfortable. There was only one movie which was anything close to my taste - more choice is needed for long-haul flights, in this case 13 hours.

The inflight experience is what I am paying for in deciding to fly business. The initial minor problems in the Sydney to Doha leg seemed to arise from our seats being in the last row in the business class section. On boarding the flight to Doha we were asked if we would like pyjamas. On replying yes, we were told only XXL was left, which were so big we could not use them. We were then asked to choose dinner. I asked for dinner to be served as soon as the plane had reached its cruising altitude. When dinner was served, approximately 30 minutes after take off, I was told my choice of wine had run out. So, of the 3 white wines available (not a great selection in the first place) the one I had chosen had run out within 30 minutes of take off. Similarly, when dessert was served we were told the one dessert wine available which we had asked for had also run out. The crew member told us only 2 half bottles had been available for the whole of the business class cabin. We complained to the cabin supervisor who apologised and said they had in fact found some dessert wine and brought us a glass. It all just seemed a little poorly organised and executed. These are small points, but this is exactly why I am willing to pay double the cost of an economy ticket for a business class service. It is the small details that make the difference. Without them, I might as well be in economy. The main problem was my seat would not fully extend to flat. The foot rest remained vertical, so it was not possible to lie down. Staff attempted to physically fix it but were unable to do so. The seat had jammed halfway between upright and flat. 3 staff spent approximately 30 minutes under the seat trying to fix it. This was about halfway through the flight, during which time we both had to stand in the aisle while they tried to fix it. The flight was full, so there was nowhere else we could go. So neither of us were able to sleep fully during the flight. On asking how we would be able to land with the seat stuck in this position, the crew suggested I might have to sit in a crew jump seat as there were no other seats available. In the end, they physically pushed the seat back into a semi-upright position that they said was sufficient for landing purposes. But no sleep for me or my partner. The cabin supervisor suggested I write in to complain. More than 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response to my initial email.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,SYD to ATH via DOH,July 2016,no,,

The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags.

We and other people ending up boarding last on the plane.  Upon arrival for transit at DOH, we were greeted with the sign that passengers to KUL please report to staff. We learned, from the first staff that our flight was overbooked by 50 people. For pax from Munich, they decided to bump us to the next flight. They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty.

There is no luggage overhead in the middle section of the cabin, so the class feels very roomy/spacious.

However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, the seats are modern with thinner padding but still comfortable. The IFE needs some improvement in the overall GUI and film choice.

Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates. To sum up, flying with Qatar still feels like 'real' business class.",Couple Leisure,Business Class,LHR to DPS via DOH,July 2016,N/A,Boeing 777,

However, this flight was terrorized by a 2-year-old toddler who screamed and cried and shouted nonstop without any attempts from her parents to comfort her nor trying to keep her volumes down. This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest. I don't fly to make friends but I always respect the privacy of my fellow travellers without putting them into such noisy, ugly nor ill-tempered torture, which was the case on QR852 from DOH to KUL this time.

Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.",Couple Leisure,Economy Class,AUH to LHR via DOH,July 2016,N/A,"A380, A320",

Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN.

In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits.

Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife.

The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant.

The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry. The absence of a modern IFE, not even a map display was available, led to tedium.

When I tried to retrieve my 3 bins at the other end of the conveyor belt, they were not contiguous, and the first was widely separated from the last, with other people's bins in between (I remember seeing other people's dirty laundry, family pictures, a jewelry box, and wad of cash). It was not trivial to re-pack the 3 bin contents into the bags - at the hotel it had taken me half an hour, but I managed to do it in 10 minutes, still too long for the impatient security staff.

Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent.

This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo.

Entertainment system did not work for part of the flight, and selections were limited. Doha Airport business lounge is on point; especially in the dining area - sincere and accommodating. Cape Town to Doha at the gate, was horrible - the woman who verified/scanned the boarding pass was so rude, and it unfortunately set the tone for me that day.

Only downside was I had a window seat so I did have to jump over the legs of fellow seat mate. To me a small price to pay for such a huge bed.

Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away (just a quiet word did the trick). In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air, I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777-EW as 3-5-3 where as Qatar have gone with 3-4-3 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings, I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main, was quick to offer an alternative. I hadn't actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am, I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatar's ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit (about £50) to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. (Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays). Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers (100+75+75) so if I wanted to place a food order for 110, I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight, took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the Manchester-Doha leg but wasn't too bothered as wasn't really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal. At the price I paid for my ticket, I will definitely fly with Qatar again and if flying from Manchester, eat at the pub on the perimeter road before checking in.",Business,Economy Class,MAN to HAN via DOH,May 2016,N/A,,

The first experience was not very promising. In Sydney the organisation was haphazard and slow, it took ages to get to a counter. The trip itself was fine - we got a two seater which gave us some more wriggle room - what was disappointing was the relative poor selection of movies available - on a 14 hour flight I found one to watch. Service was fine, I chose to forgo dinner as it was too late and breakfast (nothing appealing). Transit through Doha was relatively straightforward and the airport is well appointed. Doha to Rome was ok - no major issues although paradoxically we had a greater range of movies for the relatively shorter flight (5 hours). Later in April the flight was reversed - check in at Rome was relatively quick and certainly more efficient than Sydney - flight was fine. We had a couple of days stopover in Doha which was interesting.

I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself.

Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there.

Dressed in a t-shirt, joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class I got a look of disgust - almost as though I didn't and should have been there. How dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right? Offended to say the least. The seats and food was wonderful. Everything you expect from a good airline like Qatar Airways and for business class. It was my first time flying business so I was definitely enjoying it despite the look I received when I arrived onboard. I decided to ignore this although it gets worse. Everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. Not me! It's almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. I found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks? Disgusted. I hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. I had the money to spend on my flight and therefore I should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. I'm pretty let down as this was my first time with Qatar Airways. You should never judge someone by the clothes they're wearing or lack of make up etc. So I didn't look like a business class flyer but I'm a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight.

I was told that it would be open but I asked what would happen if it was not open and I was informed that passengers would be put on flights to Amsterdam, Paris or Dusseldorf. I therefore printed off our boarding passes to Brussels two days before the flight as requested. When we arrived at Cape Town airport 3.5 hours before the flight, we were told that our flights had been cancelled and we would have to rebook. At the booking office, we were told that there were no seats available on flights to Amsterdam, Paris, Dusseldorf or London Heathrow and all they could offer us were flights to Birmingham. If Qatar had sent us an email to inform us that our flights had been cancelled, we might have been able to find much more suitable alternatives in time. We accepted very reluctantly to fly to Birmingham, as this was extremely inconvenient, only to be told that the airline would not organise or pay for onward travel from Birmingham to Brussels. We also faced a wait of 7 hours at Doha airport instead of the previously scheduled 2 hours. We asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade or a place in the Business lounge but we were told that it was not company policy.

Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch.  Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short. Hamad Airport wasn't quite what I had hoped for. One positive note; Doha is not as busy as Dubai. Doha to Bangkok was on the fantastic A380. This flight was very good and I was lucky again and given a seat on the upper deck economy section (seat 25b). The seat was in front of the bulkhead and offered me extra legroom ones again. Smooth flight (or rather a nice inflight sleep). The return flight from Bangkok to Doha was an A380 again and was uneventfull. At Suvarnabhumi it took the ground staff quite some time to realise that their check at boarding wasn't going to work with only 1 staff member checking passports and boarding cards. After some time another staff member came and checks went quicker and the flight could depart on time. On arrival in Doha no security check, off the airplane into the terminal. The flight from Doha to Amsterdam was now on a new Boeing 777 with 10 seat abreast. Still not bad and I was happy I didn't have to sit on that awful 787. Nice flight and another fine crew.

If a special meal is ordered it seems only the main course is changed. He had to have the Arabian mezze as a starter. The first vegetarian main course he was served (Madrid-Doha) was a disaster. It was described as Asian vegetarian  and was just vegetables and rice and had to be sent back for reheating.

We boarded the plane and were greeted by the nicest crew I have encountered on a flight. Our first leg of our flight was roughly 7 hours to Doha. The plane was clean and very stylish throughout each seating class. Shortly after take off we were served breakfast which consisted the most amazing meal on an airline. We were served Waffles with strawberries and cream, We also received a hot bread roll, fruit salad, yogurt, water and fresh juice and coffee. After we were served our meal, the cabin was cleared of the breakfast and we could sit back and relax. The inflight entertainment system was great and had hundreds of movies, TV Shows, music, games to keep you happy for the long flight. A few hours into the flight we were served lunch. The food on this airline is some of best. We landed in Doha with a short 4 hour layover which was just enough to explore Qatar Airways hub airport which is a fantastic place.

The seating arrangement is 3-3-3 so this means we're seated with a stranger. But no matter, we had a good time. The cabin crew for this flight (7+ hours) were even better than the first. Our return flights were smoother, however, the flight crew from Doha to Kuala Lumpur were less friendly, loud, and noisy in the cabin.  The food were excellent especially the breakfast and lunch.

HIA was supposed to have this improved but I do not see much change nor direct gate access. Onboard the worst part is the the slow safety video, lengthy, numerous commercials (esp. on tourism, banking, and HIA glamourisation). Even worse are QR charity initiatives which are imposed on all passengers.

This is the first time for us to fly Qatar Airways since we've been flying Cathay Pacific for such a long time. There was barely a queue on business class. I approached a QR staff and asked if she could resolve my FFP issue. She was able to encode CX on the system. At least I was happy that my mileage earnings would be credited to my Marco Polo Account. We were then given our boarding pass and lounge access. We queued for the Immigration Checks, and that took us an hour for us to get through. When we get to the line for one particular immigration officer, there were like 6 people ahead of us and it took her forever to deal with each one of them. When it was our turn, it took less than 5 minutes.  We walked like a couple of minutes to get to the PAGS Lounge and it appeared like the old Cathay Pacific Lounge - I was then told learned this was the old CX Lounge which needs a serious revamp! We were welcomed onboard warmly, although disappointed to see the seat configuration was 2-2-2. I was hoping that it was 1-2-1. Service was impeccable - simply impeccable.  We preferred to have dinner an hour after take off. And when the meal service was on, I got so delighted with the breads. The Arabian Mezze was spot on and I got the second glass of Australian Shiraz. Unfortunately, the entrée was mundane.  I would prefer a third glass of Shiraz and nuts over the main. Dessert was available, but I opted to get the cheese platter to pair with my Shiraz and it was divine. We touched down at Hamad International Airport at 9.30 in the evening. Deplaned and worked through to the transfer desk for the in-city accommodation which was provided by Qatar Airways. We checked in and were given a room at the top floor, the accommodation was decent. The toiletries were L'Occitane. After a quick shower, we dozed off as the wake up call is at 4am. At 4am, we got the wake up call and checked out. The airport transfer chauffeur took us back to the airport and it was like a breeze going through immigration and security checks. We tried the Qatar Airways Al Mourjan Lounge. When I entered, I got astounded with the sheer opulent details. The high ceiling, the furnishings and all that. Basing everything on In-Flight Service not the seat configuration and design and the whole experience, I would fly Qatar Airways Business class on my next long-haul flight.",Business,Business Class,MNL to IST via DOH,November 2015,N/A,,

We are Oneworld Ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. Our first flight was on the A380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck (only 7 or 8 rows). When we checked our bags we were able to use Business class check in (Oneworld benefit was honoured! However the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and I could not change them. Frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about ""accepting"" those seats when I checked in online, did change them to our original preference. I was grateful for this and thanked her. Onboard the seat on the A380 is really good. Thin seat, but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. The recline is very good, but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. There's a decent sized IFE screen and a reasonable choice of movies. Despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. Nice enough, but the entree portion was small, and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks, but not proactive. Close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. Transferring at Hamad international was a breeze, you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge (it is different on your return). Really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. For westerners there is nice French themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. The second leg to Abu Dhabi was less than an hour in duration. The seat comfort was fine on the Boeing 777-300 and it had IFE if you wanted it. The crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice.  Overall the experience felt good value for money, albeit I wasn't bowled over given the 5 star experience I was expecting. I just think they could have made a massive impact if they'd provided a more proactive service on the upper deck economy section of the A380",Family Leisure,Economy Class,LHR to AUH via DOH,October 2015,N/A,A380 / Boeing 777-300,

On board this aircraft the legroom was really tight and I'm glad we only had less than a one hour flight. This Al Maha configuration has no seat back IFE, but this was not a problem as the flight was so short. We were served a savoury pastry and cake and a cuplet of orange juice. We arrived at Hamad International a few minutes early and the transfer process was quick and slick. Handbaggage X-Ray and personal metal detector screening. Relaxing time back in the departure lounge. Boarding was stress free as they do it by seating zone for economy. The seat was comfortable on the Boeing 777-300 and legroom more than adequate for a 7 hour flight. In common with my outbound flight the service was slow, over an hour before any service (we were in the third row of economy cabin). Dinner was nice, but entree portions are small. Drinks only served with dinner. After this you could get more drinks if you asked but the crew were not proactive offering anything other than occasional glasses of water or orange juice.

We were late arriving at DOH - no explanation or apology. So we were then late at the departure gate, where our boarding passes were checked 4 times - with the staff standing in sight of each other - crazy.

A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar.

There are two toilets at the front and two at the back and the lounge area (which surprisingly didn't seem to be used much) makes the whole area feel spacious. Passengers in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck are entirely separate and not allowed to use the lounge or wander through the business area.

I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine.

We were delayed 2 hours because a passenger onboard wasn't feeling well as the plane was taxiing out. Instead of offloading this passenger, the captain decided to wait for a doctor to treat them. The passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.  We spent the holiday fretting about the return journey, as the connection time was a mere 55 minutes, and we dreaded missing it.

When we travelled to Phuket in July we found our six year old daughter had no child meals booked. I had booked this online but it failed to register. The staff were apologetic on the plane and said they would sort the issue for when we returned in four weeks. When we arrived in Phuket we found one of our cases had not arrived. This delayed us at the airport while we had to sort this issue. On checking in online for the return journey we find our family split, with my son 20 rows back from the rest of us on the last sector. The check in staff tried to adjust this but could do nothing better than move him slightly closer.  We found our daughter had no child menu on the plane and appeared to be the only one that failed to get a child gift when they were handed out. We asked later and were told all gifts had been handed out. In Doha the airport doesn't have a Priority pass lounge.

The great option with Qatar Airways is that they fly from DWC not DXB which is a superb option. Small airport, you are through from check in to the gate in literally 5 minutes same on the return airside to landside taxi rank. I find Qatar Airways a quality consistent airline, this trip was no different, flights on time, in all directions. DWC to KTM via Doha, staff all pleasant this was a red eye, so sleep was the main requirement but unfortunetly with the aircraft used was not an option. A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative. Crew onboard generally are polite, efficient but have a feeling of being robotic, they don't know how to be personable with passengers. On all sectors there was no priority business check in or priority boarding, all aircraft were at remote stands. Food and beverage good - but fail to understand why Mezze and lamb are on every menu!

There was no priority boarding for business class from Cairo. The flight attendants were perfunctory with me (a single female student traveling), but lavished attention on the male travelers.  When the IFE malfunctioned before takeoff, I was tersely instructed not to touch the remote for 15 minutes, as if it were my fault. Thankfully, the excellent food and drink made up for the service. On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant. That was the service I was expecting when I booked Qatar Airways. The seat and IFE on the A380 was better than any airline I've flown before.

Windows seem to be larger than other aircraft. The seat is maybe a bit narrow but I got the single one which means a lot of privacy for some good rest and sleep. Cabin crew was excellent and so was the food. Restrooms are very nice and were kept clean throughout the entire flight. Have not given a try to onboard WiFi. Anyway, in my opinion this WiFi service should be free of charge for business class passengers.

Check-in at Frankfurt Airport was smooth and the Qatar Airways staff were friendly. I had chosen 29A for myself, which was extremely convenient. The cabin was airy and chilly (the way I like!), middle seat was vacant which gave me extra room to enjoy the collection of movies and music on the IFE. A good collection of Hollywood as well as Bollywood movies, and songs encompassing all genres was a treat. The seats looked new and the cabin was very clean. I had ordered a Hindu non-vegetarian meal for myself, which was surprisingly palatable, especially the chicken curry with the coconut base.

Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection.

Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time.

Qatar Airways made us quite at home for our 20 hour flight. Food was plentiful, even to the point of over eating. We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare.

Service and food was poor out of Manila Clark, but DOH-LHR route food was significantly better. Only issue is that the A330-300 seats are not flat bed like the Boeing 777, very difficult to sleep without feeling you are sliding off. Ground staff were good in Clark and solved a connection issue.

Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!",Solo Leisure,Business Class,EDI to BKK via Doha,July 2015,N/A,Boeing 787 / A380,

The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice.

Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time!

1899,2015-07-06,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Rob Bowden,United Kingdom,2015-07-06,"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there.

Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg.

I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started.

Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates.

The food and drinks on the flights were excellent, the crew could not do enough for me. I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see.

Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out.

They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good.

1920,2015-06-16,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Vietnam,2015-06-16,"Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem.

1921,2015-06-16,1,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Clarke,Saudi Arabia,2015-06-16,"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board,
something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min
delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we can’t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar.",Business,Business Class,MEL-DOH-BAH,June 2015,no,,

Check-in excellent at IAD, followed-by the use of the Virgin Clubhouse. Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the
seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money.

Very good amenity kit from Armani, the best noise cancelling headphones I have experienced on a plane.

Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew.

Much like the Cathay Pacific's of the worlds, these guys put the staid overpriced tiredness of the European airlines in perspective.  Business class on Qatar is, for example,
certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa.  Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest?  I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me.  Well it did with Qatar!  One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me!  Unreal stuff.  Or maybe this is how it should be?

SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average.

Several hot dishes presented I preferred the marinated fried fish and the beef stew. New cozy spacious shower rooms offered. A couple of small wild birds made the visit memorable and pleasurable they seem to have not only been bewildered into the airport but obviously settled there as I saw also 1-2 birds there a 2 months earlier. Business Class almost fully lie flat. Service on board top notch though food options limited on this short sector.

Denied my so much wanted cheese plate as this is not offered for short sectors (likewise no amenity kit). FA's were in a sparkling mood lifting the whole thing. Drink service quick and fairly frequent. Many drink options inc. three different champagnes and pre-take-off drinks offered. Economy class on way back was also about as good as it gets.

Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1948,2015-05-20,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,W Patrick,South Africa,2015-05-20,I flew CPT-DOH-FRA on B787/A350 (16 April 2015) and return LHR-DOH-CPT on A380/B787 (30 April 2015). All in all a massive disappointment. B787 is without doubt the most uncomfortable aircraft I have flown on and is to be avoided. Qatar Airways like most others have opted for the high density seating in economy of 3x3x3 instead of 2x4x2 for which the aircraft was designed. This results in horrendously narrow seats with poor pitch and legroom. Worst of all a hard metal entertainment box in the foot well of every window and aisle seats. The box takes at least one third of foot well space and forces ones feet close together if you wish to stretch out your legs. The metal box bites into the side of your shin and is painful and uncomfortable. The new Airbus A350 with a wider body and 3x3x3 is far better. More spacious more width and a less intrusive entrainment box in the foot well. A350 XWB wins hands-down in passenger comfort over it's rival B787. Food was average to abysmal on all sectors served lukewarm to cold. Drinks service okay and champagne and cognac a plus in economy class. On all flights the crew were friendly but surprisingly disorganised during meal service. Running backwards and forwards through the cabin to supply vegetarian meat and chicken dishes not correctly loaded in trolleys. There was a clear lack of effective communication between crew members during service. Cultural issues perhaps as the staff are a multinational mish-mash from all over the world. Better communication and cultural diversity training for staff would help. The awful cramped B787 and shockingly bad food on 2 sectors (lukewarm and mass packaged and prepared). Avoid any sectors that use the B787 Dreamliner it's a nightmare.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1949,2015-05-18,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,G Palmer,United Kingdom,2015-05-18,"Flew LHR to BKK and back a few weeks ago final destination Siem Reap in Cambodia. Picked my flights based on trying out the A380 for one leg and then other three sectors on the 777-300ER which I'd read reviews were the most comfortable. Funnily enough found the A380 segment the most enjoyable and comfortable - both hard and soft product just seemed a little bit more ""all there"" and I could swear there was more legroom in the A380 than on the 777 despite the official figures saying otherwise - Maybe seat thickness and how it's sculptured? Food is average but edible - Oh and there's no timing advantage to pre-ordering a special meal it gets loaded in the trolley and served alongside everybody else's. On the way back journey originated in Siem Reap in Cambodia on Bangkok Airways - Because they code share w QR I managed to get my luggage checked through to LHR even got boarding passes issued all the way too!",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1950,2015-05-16,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,James Choochot,United Kingdom,2015-05-16,MAN to BKK economy via Doha. Both legs delayed by at least an hour though boarding on-time. Was worried about connection at Doha but assured nothing to worry about as we had made up the lost hour. At Doha circled for over 30 mins before landing. Airport (state of the art new Hamad hub airport) in chaos due to smog. Face masks required all though airport! I have never experienced this in my life time. In-flight entertainment system excellent as are food and drinks services. This is an airline where staff appear happy in their jobs. On both legs one cooked meal (delicious) then one snack ( a wrap or a pasty) handed out. During flight soft drinks and snacks available. Good choice of free alcoholic drinks too including champagne by request. I don't usually travel economy class for long haul flights but it is well worth it with Qatar.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1951,2015-05-16,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,K Seweryn,Japan,2015-05-16,NRT-WAW end of March and WAW-NRT week later. Family with small (5 and 7) children. 1 hour late departure to Warsaw rest on time. Very good seat on NRT-DOH (and DOH-NRT) flight (772) really no problem with space for big person (185cm/110kg). On DOH-WAW much smaller (320)  but still OK for 6 hours. From Warsaw IFE wasn't working at all for one seat (have to reseat) and also was very difficult to use it on another. Overhead lights wasn't working at all for 3 seats. Small amenity kit even in economy! Food good and plenty children food in really nice box. Cabin crew not attentive but also not bad. Very recommended (especially for the price that I've paid).,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1952,2015-05-12,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Leston,United Kingdom,2015-05-12,LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit. Two meals were absolutely inedible which was really surprising.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1953,2015-05-11,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2015-05-11,DOH-DFW business class on QR733 using 777-300 (changed equipment from 777-200). According to Wikipedia the 19th longest scheduled flight in the world (16h5m). Had seat 1A with no one beside me. Usual obliging service on board from a very courteous and professional crew. Have just got onto an American Airlines flight in first where I basically had my dinner tossed at me - what a difference from QR! Flight left DOH about an hour late due to an equipment change. Nice seat good food. I have no complaints about QR. For this trip I joined their mileage program. Before I was collecting miles on QR flights using my BA account but not getting much in terms of bonus miles or progress toward higher tier status. Decided to switch over to QR's program as I have a lot of travel with QR coming up.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1954,2015-05-11,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-05-11,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets. My verdict is that Qatar Business is good but definitely not well above that of Cathay or BA as people claim.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1955,2015-05-11,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Praszek,United Kingdom,2015-05-11,Recently flew LHR-AUH-LHR with a stopover in Doha. It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay. It was a miracle that I've managed to catch a LHR flight which also arrived in London with a 20-minute delay. Despite their cheap fares I'm not going to fly with Qatar Airways anymore. I'll better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

1957,2015-04-30,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Mehta,United Kingdom,2015-04-30,Recently flew from LHR to AUH via DOH. First leg was supposed to be an A380 which I specifically booked changed to a 777 which was annoying but nonetheless very comfortable. A comfortable 3-3-3 configuration on 777 unlike other Gulf carriers which opt for a cramped 3-4-3. Transit at Hamad international was very simple a very clean and not too large airport. Lots of food given and even champagne served in economy! A320 DOH-AUH and back decent snack provided good for a short-haul. Again easy transit and onto a very new A330 back to LHR service fantastic but seats were noticeably smaller in width compared to 777 but a very new IFE. On departing LHR I arrived late at the airport but the Qatar ground staff were very reassuring and helpful making sure I caught the flight.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1958,2015-04-28,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,H Mythenmetz,Germany,2015-04-28,At the end of March and again the beginning of April we travelled from TXL to DOH in an A330-200 business class. The total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. The cabin staff on the other hand â€“ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. On our return flight there were no technical problems worth mentioning except that now the cabin crew members were more interested in chatting with each other than serving meals and drinks.,,Business Class,,,no,,
1959,2015-04-27,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ali Soufan,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1960,2015-04-27,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,2015-04-27,LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty. A good experience I am happy to repeat especially when the price for tickets was one of the best I have seen in years to get from LHR to BKK.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Nice ambience and facilities though it is already started showing its age. Toilets were not clean enough. I think QR has a good investment in hardware but its software - i.e. the crew are not as attentive as other airlines that I've travelled on before. eCheck in at ZRH was a breeze attentive ground staff by SWISSPORT. Service started from pre-meal drinks meal snack another round of pre-landing pre-pour drink which was good enough for a 5-hour flight the IFE was good but not user-friendly as you need to key in the movie number for the specific movie.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1963,2015-04-16,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P J Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2015-04-16,SHJ-DOH-NBO March 9-14th. What was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. Check-in at Sharjah was chaotic  a ground staff member belonging to Air Arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. My request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. Had to ask 3 times for the Business Class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after (finally) printing my tickets. Police controls were crowded the time spent at the VIP lounge was the only enjoyable moment. QR Chef d'Escale was very friendly and helpful. No special welcome for Privilege club old A320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. Transit time at Doha was the worst: despite QR sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit I discovered that passengers coming from/going to Sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. I had to stay overnight in the Oryx Lounge which was crowded. No earplugs nor eye mask available. At least showers were very clean and comfortable. Food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. DOH-NBO morning flight was miserable: old tired A320 no IFE for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for Privilege Club and no geovision. The same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at Doha regarding transit. My last time with Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Second leg was a A330-300 not so great seats felt worn out. Service wise I have found having travelled with Qatar that it would appear they put their 'best' staff on the Heathrow route and other routes such as Phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. Overall having been a loyal customer of Qatar over the years I am not sure I will be in the future. I agree with other comments that Qatar are riding on past reputations. Food is average at best. Inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. And entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. They did however provide bassinets for my kids (although on the Phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly). Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport is a joke lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1969,2015-04-10,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Azam,United Kingdom,2015-04-10,BKK-DOH-LHR 1/4/2015. First leg was the new A380 which I personally feel is average at best. Certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as Emirates A380. Second leg was an A340 which was fine. Service really wasn't great. Whilst staff are smiley it does feel very forced now and I can see the change over the last few years. Food again was average. Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. On the way back Qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering. Whilst I understand this is an act of nature I would like to think if you operate in a region that has extreme weather conditions then you accommodate accordingly.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Looking forward to our return journey on the A350. Also worth noting that routing FRA-SIN was so much cheaper than LHR-SIN - but more hassle to get a connecting BA flight from LhR to FRA but for the 3 of us it saved several thousand pounds!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!,,Economy Class,,,no,,

1973,2015-03-30,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,T Fosgate,United Kingdom,2015-03-30,"There are two reasons why I would never fly with Qatar airways again: 1) Their apparent policy regarding delayed flights. I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5"" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling. That said I can't fault the service-the cabin crew were efficient friendly and attentive. Shame then about 1 and 2.",,Economy Class,,,no,,

1975,2015-03-30,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Angela Brown,United Kingdom,2015-03-30,Singapore-Doha-Edinburgh on the 787. Lounge in Singapore was better than I expected after reading reviews small selection of hot and cold food and small drinks selection but it was cool and fairly quiet. Good priority boarding at Singapore and bus transfer at Doha - separate bus exclusively for business class. On both legs we were welcomed on board by name and shown to our seats and given pre takeoff drink and the offer of a newspaper and amenity bag provided. Pyjamas were only provided on the Singapore-Doha leg. At all times we were referred to by name and after takeoff CSD introduced themselves staff checked that we knew how all the controls worked on the seat and IFE I witnessed them showing great patience helping an elderly gentleman get to grips with the IFE. We were provided with a wine and food menu and it was explained that we could dine as and when we wanted. The food and wine selection was very good and the food was presented very well. The cabin crew were continuously walking the cabin quietly offering service when it was required. Found the seat very comfortable in all positions and managed to sleep for around 4-5 hours on each leg. The toilets were spacious and were kept in a spotless condition Our first experience of Qatar and I can guarantee that it won't be our last. A world apart from our outward trip on BA. Totally recommend Qatar Airways.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1976,2015-03-30,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2015-03-30,Flew HAN-BKK-DOH-DWC (Dubai “World) and return to Hanoi in March 2015 in economy (HAN-BKK-HAN on B777-3) business (BKK-DOH on A380 and DOH-BKK on B777) and first (DOH-DWC-DOH on A320) respectively. Fantastic airline in all classes. Except for “First” within middle East which is not “real” First on a A320 as the seats are only typical old style bz/class seats. But as for the A380 the bz class gives a sublime experience almost to perfection. The bar onboard offers intelligently other brands of drinks as those on the menu card served while seated. I like the herring bone seat layout and found the trip cozy and staff caring. Ate at demand. Sophisticated drink lists with many expensive items offered like several wines one normally does not access easily. As usual poor on beer options. Only small portions of food offered as compared to earlier business class experiences with QR. Staff alert and professional and truly caring. A great experience. All flights on time except one which caused a missing connection however QR instantly rebooked to my satisfaction and eventually I arrived on time to final destinations. They have a tendency to close servicing passengers on board far too early before landing (approx. 40 minutes) which is disappointing and unnecessary annoying.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service little tip they leave the Krug at the bar worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787 they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1978,2015-03-28,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Solomon Roma,India,2015-03-28,Qatar Airways has been a long time favourite as the service is extremely good. On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha. Plus the meal served on the Doha Delhi flight was really substandard - some kind of chicken korma!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1979,2015-03-28,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Kalter,United States,2015-03-28,Nice cabin on newish 777 Dreamliners PHL-Doha-Colombo. Improved legroom in coach good entertainment and food. Cabin crew well above par. One small complaint: The free Doha city tour (layover of five hrs) a great idea and heavily hyped on their site and inflight magazine can only accommodate twenty people at a time and I believe only goes out every two hours. It's a joke as thousands are connecting through at any given time. (if you haven't guessed we were bumped and somewhat casually by the ground staff in Doha who were more interested in returning to their chat than apologizing or explaining the situation).,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

1981,2015-03-23,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Younas Safyana,United Kingdom,2015-03-23,Travelled over the Christmas period 24/12/14 to 12/1/15 to Singapore Changi. Was hesitant after having read some of the reviews. It had been a couple of years since I had travelled with them last. Was traveling with family so 3 adults and 3 children aged 6 2 and 1. Overall experience was excellent and would travel with them again. The planes were fairly new. Plus points-Qatar staff at all airports from Manchester to return from Changi were great with children which was our biggest worry. Also were very helpful during all flights. Food and drink were served frequently through all flights. Only some minor negatives the entertainment for children was very basic - checked prior to flight and a lot of the programmes that had been mentioned were not available on flight which was disappointing. Also pre-ordered my mothers food who eats Asian non veg food but not beef. Requested the Hindu non- veg meal thinking they will most likely serve Chicken or Lamb for this request but to my mothers disappointment they served prawns (very lovely indeed from my point of view) so if anyone like my mother you may have to request specifically what you want prior as a special request. Would travel with them again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1982,2015-03-20,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Arman,Sweden,2015-03-20,Trip was Stockholm to Dubai via Doha (Economy class). Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner and as many have written here the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me I will choose another carrier next time.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1983,2015-03-20,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ian Swithinbank,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,Flew LHR-Doha-Cape Town out Jo'burg-Doha-LHR back. Much cheaper than BA direct flight which we have used before. Service comfort and food all several grades better than BA as well. Well worth the extra 6 hours journey time and change in Doha for the better comfort and service alone. Change at Doha with 2 hour window was easy and actually broke the journey nicely. Will do again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1984,2015-03-20,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P van Jaarsveldt,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,AMD-DOH-LHR. The lounge in Ahmedabad is very funny. All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife which is quite pleasant.,,Business Class,,,no,,
1985,2015-03-20,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P van Jaarsveldt,United Kingdom,2015-03-20,LHR-DOH-AMD and back again. The lounge in London is really nice. We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible especially compared to the old one. Its huge impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge. The flight to Ahmedabad is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1986,2015-03-17,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Pierre-Jean Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2015-03-17,BCN-DOH-DXB inbound flight made on January 5th after an outbound on December 18th with Royal Jordanian. BCN-DOH first leg was neither a good nor bad surprise: quite smooth check-in thanks to my Sapphire OneWorld status enjoyable VIP Lounge at BCN airport (although not well-provided at all about food) respected Priority Boarding no delays. Equipment was a newly-configured Airbus A330-200 I was seated in an emergency exit so I had extra legroom. Food average nice selection of beverages. Things became complicated when I collapsed on the 5th hour of the flight (hyper arterial pressure) and was put within hands of cabin crew. QR does not know how to manage a simple issue whatsoever: disembarked at DOH all the way to airport clinic then sent to Hamad hospital for further examinations. The nightmare took 19 hours. Had to fly back to DXB on the following day. Had to spend overnight at Oryx Lounge.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1987,2015-03-17,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Herrmann,Switzerland,2015-03-17,"I flew BRU-DOH-DXB and back. Even though the leg DOH-DXB is rated as first class I sub-summarize it as a business class trip because the cabin product is the same. The cabin and the seat are very comfortable nothing to complain. But the service level in general is very low. Starting by the performance of the cabin crew in business class: very hectic not really attentive. They don't use trolleys in business class they serve every guest individually from the galley. This leads to a very hectic atmosphere in the cabin because the crew has to walk a lot. They miss having any grace whilst serving it seems the invention of a service tray has been totally ignored. They bring your plate with bare hands from the galley when they realised that they forgot a spoon and knife they came back holding the spoon in one hand and the knife in the other instead of putting in on a tray and serving it nicely. On the short trip from Doha to Dubai this one-after-another type of service lead to the fact that the last business class row was served only 5 minutes prior to the start of the descent so the poor people could not even finish their meal. But the worst I had to experience was the check-in in Dubai: there was one counter for first and business class passengers and one counter for status members. Both lines totally overcrowded and the check-in procedure went on really slow. After waiting for more than 30 min. some of the first class passengers tried to move to the so called ""help desk"" to ask for check-in there. Suddenly a Qatar airways representative appeared and yelled at them they should go back to their line. I waited more than 50 minutes until I could check- in. The ""first-class"" lounge of Qatar airways is very small and old and was totally overcrowded. Not the way I want to be treated as a first or business class passenger. I think they have to do first a lot of improvement in their service level until they can compete with airlines such as Singapore Airlines.",,Business Class,,,no,,
1988,2015-03-17,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,David Pilkington,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,I had never flown with Qatar before but what a wonderful surprise. Early check in at Heathrow and returning at Kathmandu meant we had extra leg room seats on all sectors there and back. Drinks service was wonderful and you can have what you want I was allowed to have champagne with my dinner. The food choice was lovely and tasty. The staff could not do enough for the passengers I have to say I would recommend and definitely fly with Qatar again. If I had any advice I would say they needed another set of toilets on the planes and I found the seats a little tight although I am a large man and I had extra legroom so it did not matter.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1989,2015-03-17,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ari Ayam,Sweden,2015-03-17,Went with Qatar Airways from Stockholm to Dubai through Doha. First flight was with their new Boeing 787 - Dreamliner. Good entertainment system high resolution screen but slow response in the touch and a lack of music and TV-series. The seat config is not good however the leg-room is a bit disappointing. Otherwise the Dreamliner is a nice airplane. On the way back it was with the A330 which is getting old and they should really change the entertainment system onboard. It didn't even work so the flight back was quite boring. Had a short flight with their B777 also from Doha to Dubai which is probably the best airplane Qatar has got right now. More legroom good entertainment system and so on.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
1990,2015-03-17,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Fairclough,France,2015-03-17,BCN to KUL via DOH. All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and strangely row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age and frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands  not jetways. I really find it hard to see how with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline! But overall for the price it is a good product.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1991,2015-03-17,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Jason,United Kingdom,2015-03-17,Travelled Business Class DOH-FRA. Was booked on the new A350 with flat beds. Two days before the flight plane was swapped to an A330 with ski slope beds. This is the third time I have had an aircraft substitution to an inferior product with Qatar. Until they can standardise their Business Class product to that of their 787's/A380's I would not recommend them as what product you receive on the day you fly seems a total lottery. If a flat bed and sleep is a priority for you avoid.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
1992,2015-03-09,1,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Wim Timmermans,Indonesia,2015-03-09,QR 957 on Jan 9th and QR 956 on Feb 1st. CGK-DOH-CGK Business A330. First and last time. These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space and the midsection goes up. This gets you in a totally unnatural position. Their product on 380 and 777 is better but avoid the 330 at any cost. Just buy and economy seat or fly another airline who better understood the needs of BC travellers.,,Business Class,,,no,,
1993,2015-03-09,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Singer,United Kingdom,2015-03-09,LHR-DOH-DXB and back. On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA Virgin et al. Service was good though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1994,2015-03-09,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Mackenzie,France,2015-03-09,Like Alison Swain who wrote on 24 February of her surprise at the window blinds being put down and the cabin lights dimmed during a daytime flight I likewise was dismayed by the same thing on a Doha to Paris flight in November 2014. The flight was virtually empty so I just got up and opened up all the blinds that the cabin crew had shut so that I could see out and enjoy the spectacular views of Mt Ararat amongst other things. I too wondered why on earth the cabin staff were making us think we were flying at night and I found it very irritating sufficiently so that I would hesitate to fly this airline again notably as neither the seat comfort not the staff service nor the food nor the inflight entertainment were particularly noteworthy.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Nice plane tasty food but very cramped seating on this 6-7 hours flight. Doha-Dubai shorthaul on an airbus 321 with great legroom under one hour flight but they serve a small meal and beverages. Dubai-Doha airbus 330 once again great legroom and service. After the ""spacious"" seating on the short flights the seating felt even more cramped on the longer flight between Doha and Copenhagen. But new clean planes and very friendly helpful staff on all legs still made the trip a pleasure. All flights departed on time and arrived ahead schedule. Smooth boarding.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1996,2015-03-04,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2015-03-04,QR1360 JNB-DOH. Seat 4A. After an on-time departure from JNB the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory so the woman in front of me said “why don't you tell him”. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later the woman in front of me while going to the lavatory stopped at my seat and said “do I have your permission to go to the washroom?” Honestly the crew should be paying more attention not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin. A tense atmosphere on board could and should have been avoided by the crew doing their job which lets not forget is first and foremost about safety not service.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

1998,2015-03-04,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Tom Parker,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,Flew from LHR to DOH 23rd February for an onward connection to Phuket. The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
1999,2015-03-04,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Aiken,United Kingdom,2015-03-04,Manchester-Doha-Melbourne 20th Feb 2015. First leg to Doha on A330-200 not fully booked I had aisle seat plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again. Here's hoping for Airbus on the return journey.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Excellent food and drink provided by good crews. Seats comfortable but a bit tight for anyone in the window seats due to the 2-2 configuration. IFE extensive but control via the i-phone style handset a bit temperamental. As a flight that was basically a 'freebie' helped by passenger loads under 50% this was very enjoyable. However if the flights had been full I suspect I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2001,2015-03-04,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Valentine Mendanha,India,2015-03-04,Flew QR on 3 Feb to Cape Town. The Dreamliner was most disappointing. Noisy Cabin. Narrow seats no leg room. And if you are above 5'10 you will struggle to squeeze in. Food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. Nuts would have been a 100 times better. Old hindi movies and very limited choice on TV channels. Never again on QR.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

This is the second time I have flown Qatar and again was very pleased with the result. All check in staff courteous and helpful. Cabin staff very helpful. Food was simple but very good. Seat was particularly wide for Economy 18.9 inches I think and legroom and recline good.

Great to have this direct route and seems very popular especially for connections. Second time I have used this service third trip with Qatar. 787 economy seats uncomfortable the 3-3-3 configuration a strange choice. A330 service I flew on in June 2014 DOH-HKG seats were much more comfortable and 2-4-2 better. Metal box on floor on 787 restricts leg room. Leg room tight and unbearable when passenger in front reclines their seat (better leg room on Easyjet a low frills airline). Emirates 777 seats better from GLA-DXB.

2005,2015-02-24,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Alan Wan,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2006,2015-02-24,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Denzil Bourne,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was good but cheap Champagne. On-board the seat was great. Great food and beverage service. IFE was spot on too. DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times. Return sectors RGN-DOH was on the A330 comfortable seat once again the food from RGN wasn't great but I was hungry so ate it. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping) but I needed to sleep and I think I got about five hours.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2007,2015-02-24,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Alison Swain,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,Just returned to Edinburgh today on QR027 from Doha on Dreamliner. As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am which is why we booked it does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one! Just wondered if it is Qatar Airways policy to do this even on daytime flights. We were in economy 12 E & F. More legroom on short haul 737s very cramped very disappointed passenger!,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2008,2015-02-24,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anthony M Slark,United Kingdom,2015-02-24,I flew London-Doha-Kathmandu on 3rd February also in Economy class. The first flight was a Boeing 777 and the second an Airbus A-320. The first flight was one of the best I have had after a bad start. An angry inconsiderate passenger in front of me refused to put up his seat while lunch was served and was incredibly rude to me and the cabin attendant. The cabin attendant suggested I move to an empty emergency door seat which I did and had lots of legroom. The plane was immaculate as was the service. The second flight to Kathmandu was also excellent in every way. Both flights were on time and all flight attendants that I could see were extremely professional helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this airline to all. I am now looking forward to flying on the Airbus A-350.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2010,2015-02-18,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Navid Akram,Qatar,2015-02-18,Flew from DOH-LHR on the 12.50pm flight and it was my poorest experience on QA to date. Started off well in the lounge with good service but as soon as I stepped onto the plane the AC was not working. The plane set off with a known fault. During the flight my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence). What saved me from scoring the trip satisfaction as 1/10 was the usual impeccable flight crew service - top class. QA can do much better and on this flight the experience was anything but a 5* standard.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2011,2015-02-18,1,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Bob Mitchell,United Kingdom,2015-02-18,"QR836 Doha to Bangkok new Airbus A380 should have been seat 46c economy but moved for no technical reason to a small economy area on the upper deck right at the back of the aircraft. Seat 27G. I chose seat 46c because of its position forward of the leading edge of the wing which on other 380's such as Emirates and Singapore are both relatively quiet and comfortable in turbulence. This new position was noisy (engine) and dreadful in turbulence because you are so close to the tail. I understand airlines cannot guarantee your seat request ""for technical reasons"" but there was nothing wrong with the seat I had chosen. My guess is that as a solo traveller I was probably moved to accommodate a group of two or more travellers that left there checking in and seat reservations until the last minute. I would love to know why people who book flights five or six moths in advance should be penalised for others that either book last minute or don't check in until the last minute. I was told by the cabin purser that the ground staff had moved many people and that that many passengers had complained.",,Economy Class,,,no,,

2013,2015-02-12,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Meier,Germany,2015-02-12,4 flights 3 of them were a very nice experience. New planes on time and very fast good service. Flight nr. 4 (7h) was with a older A330 and the crew was not so motivated or a bit disorganised. Very slow service. They skipped the first run with drinks and snack and start to serve with the dinner after a while. It took more than 90 minutes to get the first drinks and some food. That flight was a very different experience and not what you expect from a 5 star airline. The new economy seats at the 787 are not very comfortable. hard narrow and a metal box under the seat.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2014,2015-02-12,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Stonfer,United States,2015-02-12,"Flew on 787 Dreamliner from Doha to Singapore. Must say I was so close to my neighbor that I was afraid we would amalgamate into one! All the other amenities and food experience went right out of the window. Anyway all the other things like food entertainment crew were good. But none of it matters when a 6"" slightly heavy guy sits in the plane. Qatar Airways might be doing a great job in the Premium Class but since majority of the people travel by economy it should rethink its strategy. Chances of me travelling on Qatar are very small.",,Economy Class,,,no,,

Really annoying when your in a airplane for 14 hours straight. I encourage them to check their systems.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2016,2015-02-12,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Ghannadian,United States,2015-02-12,I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2017,2015-02-06,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2015-02-06,JNB-DOH-KWI business class. Seat 4K on JNB-DOH on Dreamliner. On boarding went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights. I like the 1-2-1 seating in biz class on the 787.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The newer aircraft on the first leg provided softer seating and entertainment on demand while the older A320 on the second leg had harder seating and no entertainment. Legroom is an issue because of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you (F seats) but otherwise okay. Recline is generous even though people behind you complain that it invades their space.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Catering however for special diet (gluten free) was awful. Nicely presented but just dry chicken FOUR times over the 2 legs! GF is very easy diet to produce tasty meal. Just had a far better one on Qantas domestic flight in economy! Have flown all major airlines to Oz and this was the worst for me for food.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2020,2015-01-28,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Daniel Ludwig,Sri Lanka,2015-01-28,CMB-FRA business class. I took the night flight and I arrived rested in Germany 30 minutes earlier than expected so I was able to change my connecting flight within Germany and arrived earlier at my final destination in Germany. On my return to CMB in Frankfurt the ground handling staff were very impolite firstly when they didn't know which class I was in suddenly when they saw my ticket a smile appeared this shouldn't be every customer should be treated the same way. The flight from FRA to DOH had a delay therefore the connecting time to DOH to CMB was only 30 minutes. As earlier stated in some of the reviews from others some of the planes business class is just a better economic class as you are unable to rest. However I wouldn't mind recommending the airline.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2021,2015-01-28,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C McLuckie,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,Flew economy on Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Edinburgh to Bali via Doha. Worst seating I have encountered in economy. Not only are the seats very narrow but some design genius who has never flown economy thought it would be a good feature to locate a large IFE box under the seat so one leg will always be constantly rubbing against it. When the seat in front is reclined there is no room to move so the people in the window or middle seat are trapped. Service was ok but choice of movies not as extensive as Emirates.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2022,2015-01-28,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A M Slark,United Kingdom,2015-01-28,Flew QR 651 Kathmandu-Doha on 20th Jan and QR 11 Doha-LHR on 21st Jan. Both flights in economy class and were excellent. The first flight was on an Airbus 330 and the second on an Airbus 340. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. A small wet towel to freshen up after wake up would have been nice before we ate breakfast. Both flights were punctual. Food was as good as can be expected on a flight. The new Hamad Airport in Doha can only be described as superb in every way. My next journey will be on 3rd February LHR-DOH-KTM and two further round trips expected this year.

I would not hesitate in recommending them. I believe this is the best economy class flight I have been on. Spacious seating tasty food and friendly attentive staff. I have experience of long haul flights where the cabin crew get the service out of the way as quickly as possible and then disappear behind a curtain for the rest of the flight. This was not like that at all. They were helpful throughout the flight. I was very impressed.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2025,2015-01-26,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2015-01-26,QR708 IAD-DOH. Seat 3K. Not sure what happened to QR this evening but from the start it is not what one expects from this carrier. My last four trips with QR including this one have entailed lengthy business class check-in waits at IAD. Why can't QR at IAD have enough dedicated business class check-in counters to manage the flow of checking-in passengers in a way that prioritizes high yield customers? Waiting 30 minutes to check-in from the business class line while watching economy class passengers who arrived well after me breeze up to the counter is just not acceptable. QR needs to look at this seriously. This isn't the first time I've encountered this while checking in for this flight at IAD. The flight left early. Turbulence early on delayed the dinner service. However once it started the left aisle of the business cabin was on to their second course before passengers on the right aisle even had a drink. The purser should ensure consistency throughout the cabin. The FA working in my aisle asked if she could clear my service items before I'd even been served the main course. I informed her that I hadn't had dinner yet. When ordering appetizers I was told that one of my appetizer selections might not be available as many other passengers had ordered the same thing. Really? The business cabin is not full and I'm in row 3. My main course for the dinner a lamb shank with root vegetables was entirely under-whelming. When put in front of me the sauces were congealed. Once I started to eat it it was only tepidly warm. The purser came around and asked me how my meal was and I told her it was not hot and that it looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a nice smile and an I'm sorry Sir but no offer to have it re-heated or replaced. What particularly irked me was that just minutes after take-off the purser went around the cabin summarily closing everyone's window shades. A hand appeared from the row behind me to close the window that I was looking out of at that moment admiring the night time view of New York. There's lots of time remaining just after take off on a night-time transatlantic flight for FAs to go around the cabin and discretely close the window shades before sunrise. Believe it or not some passengers may want to see the night-time lights of New York Boston Halifax or St. John's. If they want to close all the shades early on in the flight they can at the least ask passengers if they want their shades drawn rather than just briskly machine-like marching around the cabin closing them. Passengers typically chose window seats for a reason. Sorry QR not one of your better days.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2026,2015-01-21,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,David Gilbert,Italy,2015-01-21,"MXP-DOH-INC - PEK-DOH-MXP. 3 flights out of 4 on the 777 1 on the 330. Business seat on the 777 far superior compared to the rather cramped and angled 330. What I liked on the 777 seat is the fact that there is plenty of space and no ""foot box"" so you can sleep in any position and have freedom of movement. The 330 had the ""foot box"" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge. Would recommend Qatar but beware of travelling on the cramped 330 business class which is ok for a day flight but not a night flight.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2027,2015-01-21,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Elton Chapman,United Kingdom,2015-01-21,Outbound LHR-DOH-MEL return MEL-DOH-MAN. 3rd time flying Qatar business class. The Qatar lounge at LHR is incredible. Modern well designed comfortable with great staff and fantastic food and drinks on offer. We had a full breakfast with a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a great way to start our vacation. Our first flight from LHR was on the three class A340-600 and I was impressed. This was our first time on this aircraft type with Qatar and I was surprised how spacious it was. The angled lie flat seat was comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep. The galley is at the rear of business class so the front seats get served last. We had a couple of hours to kill in Doha before our next flight to Melbourne. This was our first time at the new Hamad airport. It was great not to have to do the long bus tour of the airport as you did at the old terminal. The business class lounge is really badly sign-posted but we found it eventually. The lounge was impressive but I think I was expecting more. Table service drinks throughout the lounge apart from one proper bar which is located upstairs. Return flights to Melbourne were on the 2 class 777. The space in business is incredible and the lie flat seats are comfortable. First time we've been given the mattresses which you now get with the usual PJs and slippers but only on night flights. I thought the mattress was a nice touch and added to the overall comfort. Our return flight from Melbourne used the Qantas business lounge which was really poor. Uncomfortable and a very poor selection of food and drink. I was glad to get out of there. Our Melbourne departure was delayed by 45 minutes and we only had a 65 minute transfer time at Doha. From my experience great customer service comes into play when things go wrong (like flight delays) and Qatar handled things superbly. We were met as we left the aircraft with details of our transfer gate and the aircraft was held on stand for us until we arrived. Our luggage was fast tracked and I was amazed to see it on the carousel at Manchester airport. The flight to Manchester was on the smaller A330.200 but again a great aircraft (slightly older) with an angled lie flat seat. Food and beverage on all flights was to a really good standard. But what really makes Qatar stand out though is the consistently high standard of service in business class. I was really impressed with this on all our flights and their five star status really is deserved.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The service both on land and in flight was exceptional!!!! The food and food presentation was first class! A pure joy in relation to other airlines we have flown. The air stewards were always willing to help well dressed and had a good attitude at all times. There is ample leg room even with the entertainment box if there was one at our feet. If you wish to fly Qatar please take a converter for your personal headphones as theirs is a 2 prong. We had a 24 hour lay over in Doha. Qatar Airways granted us an accommodation and food voucher. Our stay in Doha was wonderful and memorable. It is an easy process at Hamad Airport to get the vouchers and board the shuttle to the relevant hotel. I was anxious about this period but it was an easy stay over. My husband and I highly recommend Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Overall a very pleasant experience as the flight was clean and new the staff were extremely friendly and I loved the special meal options. We all had our own TV screens as well which was really entertaining. The only negative thing about Qatar Airways is that the legroom is very limited which disappointed me as I really needed some leg room to relax as I am 185 cm tall (a very normal height here in Europe). I hope Qatar Airways will provide some more legroom to its passengers.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2030,2015-01-19,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Wijesinghe,United States,2015-01-19,"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one. I would use QR again on this route due to their three daily flights to CMB and their OneWorld membership that allows me to earn Avios and Tier benefits as a Sapphire OneWorld member.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2031,2015-01-19,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Pillai Sreenath,France,2015-01-19,I had flown on BRU-DOH-BOM leg which was a nice and enjoyable trip for me. The check-in was quite comfortable for me. Considering the fact that I have some health issues pertaining to my back I was allotted a bulkhead seat with extra-leg space for the BRU-DOH 8 hour long sector. The welcoming by the cabin crew was very appealing and we were served with fresh towels and candies. The in-flight entertainment was also good since they had movies and other audio-visuals in the most updated forms. The food served was very delicious and was specifically served to me as per my special request for food. All the cabin crew were very pleasant and had a smiling face all the time which was very warming for everyone. The only drawback here was that the cabin crew being English speaking could not communicate with the mostly French and Dutch speaking passengers. Overall I recommend it for further trip. I have my return leg with Qatar Airways and will update you soon about my other experience.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

The change of planes in the middle of the night is not that great but the advantage is that you quickly go to sleep on the second leg.

DFW-DOH-BOM R/T on QR 777 (LR and ER) in business with family over the holidays. I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class. In my 15 years of top tier business travel this business class experience stood out as the best. Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits mattress pads duvets pyjamas superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable. The shower amenities (L'Occitane) and the restaurants in the lounge are excellent (yes Krug is still being served in the business restaurant). The bus transfer (once) was in a bus with 8 lounge style sofa seats. A good way to start the new year!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2034,2015-01-19,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Khan,Palestinian Territories,2015-01-19,Manchester-Doha sector.–While boarding had to wait in the walkway leading to the aircraft door as clearing of the aircraft was in final stages of completion unfortunately icy cold gusts of wind were funnelling into the tunnel. However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32” and width of ~18” is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic ‘sardine-can’ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the ‘quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree. The flight left on time according to the new delayed schedule and service on board was as good as always cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful throughout catering quality/quantity somewhat less than previous experiences but quite acceptable. The aircraft was well maintained and the as clean and tidy as I have always experienced with Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

The entertainment system didn't show any flight info or map. Doha to Bangkok - 1.5 hours into the flight they served a small snack - a spinach pie for vegetarians or chicken pie. After some 5 hours they served a small breakfast - nothing special for an 8 hours flight. The plane was an A380 which was the best of the 4 we travelled on during this trip. At least it was clean and comfortable for a long flight. For the SIN-DOH leg they used a B787 which was new but uncomfortable for tall passengers. Once seats recline it's practically impossible to eat or stand up. The breakfast 1 hour before Doha was so bad thst we gave it back untouched. Doha to Athens entertainment system at seat did not work but the A330 was not full so we could change seats. They served the same breakfast as SIN-DOH. The A330 was full of dust - the seat pocket was full of garbage from the last flight.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

2038,2015-01-14,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Keep,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2039,2015-01-14,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Kay,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,EDI-DOH-SGN. Short 75 minute transfer in Doha but everything went smoothly. Usual Hugh quality of food drink and service. The only downside was that the AV on the first sector (Dreamliner) didn't work.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2040,2015-01-14,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Heidu Oliver,Germany,2015-01-14,MUC-DOH-KUL-SIN-DOH-MUC. My second trip with Qatar Airways. Crew and staff were very good at dealing with their tasks. Very friendly flight attendants. Food and Drinks were ok. 787 is a real dream. Very nice IFE system and also a nice atmosphere in the plane. A330 is also pretty decent but IFE system could be newer. Overall no problems with transfer or baggage. Will fly with them next year too.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2041,2015-01-14,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Kay,United Kingdom,2015-01-14,SGN-DOH-EDI. Very strange first sector. There seemed to be fewer cabin crew serving our side of the cabin and the guy we encountered most seemed very flustered almost as if it were his first day on the job. The printed menu card was substituted with a photocopied equivalent when our food order was taken and it featured a few changes none of them for the better. They also quickly ran out of rose champagne and one of the white wines. The next sector to EDI was superb particularly the attentive cabin crew.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2042,2015-01-11,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Nazmul,Sweden,2015-01-11,ARN-DOH-DAC and return in economy. ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent the IFE was modern flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2043,2015-01-11,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Becu John,Australia,2015-01-11,Our flight was Perth Australia to Manchester UK return and it was a pleasure. We had lie flat beds Perth to Doha. These are excellent even if you don't want to sleep but just want to stretch out. The cabin service was the best I have experienced in Business Class. You can have your meals when you want them. The service was always there and always excellent without being obtrusive. We will certainly be flying with Qatar again this year.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2044,2015-01-11,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Thakkar,United States,2015-01-11,Dallas-Doha-Bombay r/t in Business Class. Awesome experience. Excellent seats on B-777 ER/LR superb food (presented first class style - not a tray in sight) awesome lounge in Doha and service from the crew - best I have experienced (and I fly over 150K miles/year with One World). In fact I was on Cathay First a couple weeks prior from LAX-HKG-LAX and this QR service was as good or better (certainly better food on QR business than CX First). Great seat comfort with mattress toppers and duvets and seat massage function Excellent wines (presented restaurant style) and Champagnes - flawless. My wife and 2 kids felt the same way.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2046,2015-01-05,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2015-01-05,DOH-CPH-DOH-SGN on 18 Dec and 29-30 Dec. 2014. All flights on time. B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA’s professional hard working coping and caring despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge impressive but lacks personality decorations and toilets. Meals on order.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2047,2015-01-05,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2015-01-05,SGN-DOH on 17 December 2014. I was smoothly upgraded by miles from their Frequent Flyer Program using “QCredits. This was the only leg on business class (out of 4) enabling me to compare with economy. The A330-200 on SGN-DOH business class seats are flat but not fully horizontal (only decline to 165 degrees) making sleeping horrible. Night-kit and nice cotton pyjamas provided. Service top notch and wines in ultra-top class! Food served on demand and excellent but portions have become very small recently and 2-3 dishes are needed to make up a full meal. FA's the most professional alert and caring I have experienced for long time. Now 4 beers to choose among and the 2 champagne offered are exclusive though still beaten by some of the wines served. Cheese plates nice. Granted access to Business class lounge in Doha despite onwards travel was only in economy.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2048,2015-01-05,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Middleton Steven,Qatar,2015-01-05,DOH-BKK-DOH-MAN-DOH-BKK. Flew from Doha to BKK on the A380. Booked business class but got an upgrade to 1st. (Been with Qatar Airways for several years). 1st Class is nice on the 380 but I'm not convinced of its value for money compared to regular business class. Food was 'so-so' although choice of beverages is excellent. Cabin crew were wonderful as always. Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again the food was only just adequate. I think they must have changed caterers because only a year or so ago the food was always excellent.,,First Class,,,N/A,,
2049,2015-01-05,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Clark Karen,Australia,2015-01-05,Per-Doh-Mad November 13 Jo'burg-Doh-Perth. All flight except Jo'burg - Doha on 777. The standard of service in business class on all flights was very good. The best being the Doha - Perth flight were the flight attendants were particularly attentive. All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me. Will continue to fly with Qatar as they offer one of the best business class products in the air.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2050,2015-01-05,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ross Kelly,United Arab Emirates,2015-01-05,We flew DXB-DOH-HKT in business return all on the A330 except the last leg on the 787. Very good service from the crew but can be a bit slow in getting drinks and food out. Business cabin is what you would expect from a quality airline like QR very good. IFE is good and food is not bad for airline food. All flights were on time. Business class in the dreamliner is excellent would love to fly a longer route on it. The lounge in DOH is excellent and massive! The Lounge in Phuket is a joke operated by Thai Airways I dont know why QR use it as the lounge beside it which Etihad use is much better. Definitely would fly Qatar again and recommend them.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2051,2015-01-05,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Nazmul,Sweden,2015-01-05,ARN-DOH-DAC return in economy. First leg ARN-DOH operated by a Boeing 787-8 was quite excited to fly on the B787 for the first time. We had checked in online so no long queues for us! Boarding was done on-time and efficiently. I was quite impressed with the lighting in the cabin however it felt fairly cramped in a 9-abreast configuration. The flight was about 80% full. Legroom was decent food was great the IFE was great and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Transfer in Doha was smooth the next flight DOH-DAC operated by an A333. Plane change from two class A333 to three class A333. Our chosen seats got changed the staff handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal which was okay nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2052,2014-12-31,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,O Ethan,Malaysia,2014-12-31,Flew KUL-DOH-CDG-DOH-KUL. Two flights from and to KUL was operated by an A330-200 while both the flights to and from CDG was operated by their all new A380. First leg was a night flight and the crew was fantastic! They were friendly smiling all the way and nit showing the rushing face even though it was quite a full flight. Food and beverages good portions not too small and had a wide selections of beverages as for IFE selections was ok for adults but for kids not very much. On all the other 3 legs crews were very robotic but did their job. The A380 was a great plane seats were spacious enough and modern. Noticed food catered from DOH not that good but still edible... Pilots on all flights landed perfectly but they seem to be mumbling all the time. Price of tickets were very reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up for Qatar Airways!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2053,2014-12-31,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ian Francis,United Kingdom,2014-12-31,"Perth - Doha - Manchester 14-15th December 2014. Perth - Doha flight - usual B777. Full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. Have used Qatar over last few years on this run. Standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past (although a full flight could explain this). IFE very poor and aircraft seemed ""grubby"" (clean but well used). Doha - Man. Airbus 330. Seats tight in width but good IFE aircraft appeared very new. Flight 2/3rds full but cabin service was very poor. Cabin crew sullen only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy (they did not even appear to chat to each other). Certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced (the one exception being Iberia on a trip to Argentina). Maybe this was a one off but certainly I will now consider an alternative airline for this run.",,Economy Class,,,no,,
2054,2014-12-31,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Cuneo Devon,Australia,2014-12-31,I recently flew from Perth to Paris. The attendants were lovely and the food wasn't bad (it has certainly improved since my first Qatar flight). However the movie selection was dreadful as usual. I do not understand why they can't have a good selection of recent releases as all the general movies they show have been seen 100 times! The flight from Doha to Paris was great - comfortable and I love the new Doha airport. Despite the IFE I would still travel to Paris from Perth on Qatar because they have really great take off and landing times both ways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2055,2014-12-31,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2014-12-31,KWI-DOH on newly refurbished A320 with 2-2 lie flat seats angled toward the windows. Great if US carriers could copy this modely especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US. Service was obliging for this one-hour sector. Connected in DOH to IAD on a 777-300 and was in seat 6K. Overall service was good but somewhat slow due the chief purser having to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with one selfish and disruptive passenger from Qatar who insisted on bringing his toddler up from economy even though the child not was ticketed in business. He loudly argued with the flight attendants including telling them that he was friends with the Qatar Airways CEO. The chief purser handled the situation admirably and the child was eventually taken back with his nannies in economy. This overly entitled passenger though the plane was his own and that he could do as he liked. Food was good. Call button not always answered very promptly. Washroom kept clean. A great product overall.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2056,2014-12-31,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Kumar Pankaj,India,2014-12-31,Flew Dubai-Doha-Colombo with my wife and child in economy. Overall OK food was OK options finish quickly and you have to manage with what is available. Leg room was OK restricted due to entertainment box under the seat. Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers but repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience will fly them again but not worth becoming loyal to them.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2057,2014-12-22,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,K Sanger,United Kingdom,2014-12-22,We flew Bangkok to London return. So with a change in Doha 4 different flights and they all vary. The flights to London were good and especially the first leg with excellent service from the staff. Good food too. But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha bus connections is now a drag.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2058,2014-12-22,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ian Francis,United Kingdom,2014-12-22,"Have used Qatar a number of times for Manchester to Perth via Doha and return always in economy. Sunday 14th Dec 2014. First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. No smiles indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley not even chatting to each other. I doubt very much that I will use Qatar again.",,Economy Class,,,no,,
2059,2014-12-18,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Benjamin Lawrence,Australia,2014-12-18,Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2060,2014-12-18,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,L Buttle,United Kingdom,2014-12-18,LHR-DOH-PER-DOH-LHR. Flew the 4 sectors on 777-300 ER recently in Economy. They do a lot of things very well but Seating Inflight Entertainment and Beverages really harm their efforts. Seating is reasonable but what a nonsense on all 4 sectors the recline was! Goes back much too far clears any food and drink off of the table into the lap of the person behind I saw it happen twice and had a very narrow escape myself! When food and drink are not an issue the screen on a fully reclined seat is too much in your face. Drinks were infrequent and if you ordered a Spirit mixer eg. gin & tonic they mixed it for you (in varying strengths) rather than give you the standard small spirit bottle and separate mixer. Small point but again not 5 star standard. Inflight entertainment was good but not great. These are like for like comparisons if the price and schedules are better with Qatar then you may prefer to overlook these issues. Drinks and IFE are small irritations but compared to others they are falling short.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2061,2014-12-10,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Sprow,China,2014-12-10,PVG-DOH-PVG good to have a non-stop flight from Shanghai. Qatar is pleasant and reliable food was below average even for Economy cabin was about 80% full so was able to get an open seat next to me. Entertainment is average not as comprehensive or as up to date as Emirates. Staff were ok but somehow seem cool and disengaged or at least not as personable as on other carriers 777 aircraft was fine service was on time new Doha airport is very handsome and much improved with great lounge space accessible to frequent travelers even holding Economy seats. Not clear why Doha sometimes still uses bus connections to remote parking for arriving flights.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2062,2014-12-10,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Saraiva,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,I flew London/Dubai and return via Doha in economy class. All 4 legs were on-time or even early! Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed professional but not exactly warm and friendly.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2063,2014-12-10,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Robert Szocik,United Kingdom,2014-12-10,Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2064,2014-12-10,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2014-12-10,QR707 DOH-IAD. Got on board and after an hour informed that the overhead lights don't work and that the crew had informed ground personnel about the problem before push back but that nothing could be done. I would have appreciated being informed by the crew when they introduced themselves that there was a problem with the overhead lights particularly given that it is a daytime 14-hour flights when some passengers may wish to work. Service on board was good. Food was very good well presented and prepared and very tasty. Flight departed on time. Check in easy with lots of staff to greet and provide directions. Overall a good product at a competitive fare for business class from the US to the Gulf States.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

A330 not as good as the 777 and feared the angled flat seat and then had the best night's sleep I've had on a plane! Best flight of the lot for service and food. A320 CMB-DOH with a regional business class seat for 5.5 hour flight worst flight of the 4 despite a lovely crew. Just not a suitable seat for that length of flight - the 2 other flights from CMB are A330 and 777 with a ""proper"" business class seat. I wouldn't do this flight again but it did work with the schedule I needed. Delayed and therefore missed my connection in DOH as India closed it's airspace due to a missile test. Not Qatar's fault and very well handled was re-booked before I checked in on to the later LHR flight. A319 all business class. Comfortable seat OK food not a great crew overly attentive again and far too many announcements. Felt claustrophobic in such a small plane for a 8 hour flight. Suggest QR get a widebody on that flight and make some more money with economy passengers and cargo - would be better for everyone!

Flight crew promised to ""reset"" my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me. After about 2 hours I again informed another flight attendant who ""tried to reset"" with no success.

2067,2014-12-04,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Lubis,Indonesia,2014-12-04,CGK-DOH-LHR first time flying with Qatar. Selected them solely based on good reviews and 5 star status and wanted to try their new A380 to LHR. CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed. Not a very good experience especially considering DOH-LHR is one of QR's flagship route.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Leg space food and service was very good. Doha to Dubai with the B787 Dreamliner although this is a new aircraft the leg space was bad. On 12 November 2014 return from Doha again with the Airbus A330-300 very nice flight with good service.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2074,2014-11-20,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M LaPrairie,United States,2014-11-20,IAD-DOH-KWI business class on Nov 9. At check in IAD I asked the agent if there were any infants seated in the first economy bulkhead as I was in the last row of business class. He said there were two infants booked on the flight but both were located at the back of the aircraft. An infant which screamed for the first two hours of the flight was located right behind me. At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked. Well equipped lounge with lots of dining options and very spread out. DOH-KWI was on the new 787. The interior of the cabin is cool with great ambient lighting and seat comfortable. I like the sparkling rose before take-off. I wish the sector had been a bit longer to enjoy it more. All flights were spot on time.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2075,2014-11-20,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Tofara Jonera,Australia,2014-11-20,Flew Melbourne to London via Doha. The flight was pleasant from Melbourne to Doha. The entertainment system wasn't working or up to date. The cabin crew kept resetting the system but it did not work. I was forced to change seats. From Melbourne to Doha it was a good flight - no issues. Don't know whether I would use Qatar again in the near future.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2076,2014-11-17,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Swan,Australia,2014-11-17,Flew for the first time with Qatar from Perth to Dar Es Salaam. Have flown with other airlines in the past. Qatar was adequately comfortable for such a long flight. I ordered a special meal and was still given the option of the regular menu. Was impressed by the range of nationalities of the cabin crew. Someone was bound to speak your language.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2077,2014-11-12,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Amit,India,2014-11-12,Have been a regular on Qatar Airways during last 3 years on Delhi-Doha-Lagos. Travelled in Economy and Business. Experience in economy is mixed. Seating is ok in 2x4x2 configuration but less keen on the 3x3x3 configuration which seems cramped. Staff service can be variable on Doha-Delhi sector - especially with people who are not comfortable speaking English. Business class is quite good. Very comfortable. Cabin crew feed you like crazy. Choice of food and wine is good. Ground handling and luggage service is good.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2078,2014-11-12,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,James Laskowski,Thailand,2014-11-12,"BKK-MAD return with a short layover in new Doha airport. Perfect. From the ease of online booking to check-in from gate to flight services (food is really good and Beverage selection is superb.) Inflight entertainment is Excellent. The headrest that folds makes for a comfortable trip. I am 5'7"" leg room was very adequate even if the person in front reclined. Staff were always friendly and smiling.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2079,2014-11-12,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Zafrullah Hamzah,Ireland,2014-11-12,First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2080,2014-11-11,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,2014-11-11,Finally I get to fly on the Dreamliner! And Qatar Airways made the experience world class. As you board the plane you notice your first difference. The entrance of the 787 is very open and grand. You nearly feel like you're walking into a lobby area. Then you notice the windows which are truly big. Love the expansive feeling you get by being so connected to the outside. When you finally get to the new business class seat which has a very spacious 1-2-1 configuration you realize why Qatar is one of the few 5-star airlines. The reverse herring bone layout has you facing into the large windows and has by far the best design I've ever seen given this configuration even in sleep mode. An excellent dining experience. If there is one slight doubt it's with the new IFE system which takes some time getting used to. It's a complete redesign and not always logical. At least to me. Did I mention the spacious lavatories? Their Dreamliner experience is perfection.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2081,2014-11-06,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Fro Kalle,Norway,2014-11-06,Heathrow-Doha-Ho Chi Minh B777-300ER and it was a pleasant and a comfortable journey. Great cabin crew very friendly and polite. The food onboard seems less then last time in 2013 and that was a bit disappointment. Transfer at DOH beautiful new airport great design. Flight from Doha to Ho Chi Minh with the A330. The IFE onboard seems pretty old old seats and no touch screen. Many movies but not so many movies in the action category. SGN-DOH - Pleasant and an enjoyable flight. Landed on time. The problem was that my next flight to Doha- Oslo was leaving 9 hours later so pretty boring to wait so long. Great restaurant and food in the airport. B787 for the next flight. Good flight but I found out that the music didn't work and played different songs to those selected. Food was ok but I wish it was more. I sat on the back and didn't get my choice of food but that was ok. Landed on time at Oslo. I do recommend Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2082,2014-11-06,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Dianne Averis,Australia,2014-11-06,Superb service with Qatar on business class. The only downer is the lounge in Paris which is shared with a few other airlines and offered only packaged snacks and a few sandwiches. Inflight - so nice to be able to choose when we wanted to eat. The food was fresh and delicious and presented to us whenever we wanted. The service could not have been better. Yes and pyjamas and the extras too. Qatar were superb in every way (did I mention the Krug at the lounge in Doha?) If only they flew into Adelaide!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2083,2014-11-03,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Peter Lewis,United Kingdom,2014-11-03,LHR-DOH on new A380 service. Interior very similar to Dreamliner - fantastic seat and big personal screen. Additional storage with side bins on the upper deck. Spent much of the flight in the Bar - very cool and whilst perhaps a bit of a gimmick it was very nice and with great service. Toilets were the poshest I have seen. These planes were a long time coming for Qatar but in my view well worth the wait - only trouble is it will make flying anything else (except perhaps their Dreamliner) a bit of a chore!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2084,2014-11-03,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M R Higgins,United Kingdom,2014-11-03,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all MAN-DOH-DPS and BKK-DOH-MAN. Took these flights a couple of weeks ago and on every one of the 4 flights the service and the food were indeed 5 star quality. The service in the business class lounge at Doha was also excellent. The only gripe I would have on the flights is that the choice of movies is very poor - Premieres and recent releases I really don't think so.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2085,2014-11-03,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Daniel Sharon,Italy,2014-11-03,TBS-DOH-MXP. Both aircraft's seemed relatively new but the heating made it unbearable (especially on the TBS-DOH leg). It felt like a sauna and even the crew agreed but couldn't do anything about it. The vegetarian meals I ordered were not inspiring. The light snacks are a piece of sweet and a piece of savoury. The savoury was just OK the sweet was dry and burned i.e: inedible. On board Staff were miss and go. Most of the crew (Asians and Arabs) were friendly and genuinely eager to please but some of the Eastern European ladies were cold and not very approachable. Doha Airport is new and impressive. My connection was 5 hours long and so I went to the Ortyx Lounge that charges around $40 (140QR). The Lounge was very busy (500+ people) and there is only one shower facility. Luckily I found a slot to shower else the onward flight would have been even more awful than the first. I was happy to got an emergency exit seat (10D) on the DOH - MXP flight to discover this was the worst possible choice of seat. It is on an 'angle' and so it provides even less legroom than the regular seats with people going in and out of toilet and the crew bumping into me non stop.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2086,2014-10-31,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2014-10-31,Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I’ve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked another two flights with my favourite airline.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2089,2014-10-28,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,W Coulton,Australia,2014-10-28,PER-DOH-FRA with return CDG-DOH-PER. All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in. Connection in DOH was a breeze (we had over 2 hours each way). Based on these 4 flights we are happy to recommend QR and will include them in future considerations.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2090,2014-10-28,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,W Simpson,Thailand,2014-10-28,Travelled BKK-DOH-EDI on 10 Sep and was impressed with all aspects of QR. Use of THAI lounge at BKK is a real let down. Inflight service excellent. DOH Business Class lounge excellent. Returned EDI-DOH-BKK on 15 Oct. Flight departure delayed by 1 hour which caused some anxiety given a 1.5h stopover. But this was made up so there was a 55 minute stopover allowing us and our luggage to connect successfully. Inflight service on both sectors excellent. Boarding at DOH chaotic with no accessible separate boarding at gate for Business. Food is OK but not exceptional. But any downsides are certainly made up for by service which is above and beyond.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2091,2014-10-28,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P J Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2014-10-28,DXB-DOH-BCN. October 13rd. Overall a good product but I have yo admit nothing exceptional. First leg DXB-DOH was ok onboard a new A320 transfer at DOH was smooth and efficient thanks to the excellent PC Gold and Business class lounge. However ground staff was very disorganised looking like headless chickens. Second leg onboard new A330-200 ok but food was just awful. New 330 seats are also quite cramped. Both flights on time. Definitely a right choice.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2093,2014-10-28,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Y Sim,Singapore,2014-10-28,Flew outbound SIN-VIE return ZRH-SIN both transit through Doha. In-flight services and entertainment were good however food were below average for a premium airline. Seating arrangement on the Dreamliner economy class were 3x3x3 found it inconvenient for couples especially seating by the windows. Seating space were just okay for small built any taller than 1.75m might be a tight squeeze. Our inbound transit at Hamad Doha were from remote parking bay. Although bus shuttle to the terminal were smooth we were quite disappointed that such a premium airline felt very much budget oriented. The only consolation was we got the tickets cheap during promotion. The saving grace was flights were punctual for all 4 sectors which is very important to any traveler.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The first part GRU-DOH we flew out on a 777-200LR it was clean inside and we loved the full flat bed. The other part DOH-SIN on their new 787 a first time for me on the Dreamliner excellent airplane. Very good seat pitch and width. We had a excellent staff service in both parts. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. Food was tasted fresh and the best airline food we have tasted quite frankly.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2095,2014-10-22,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Arrie,Malaysia,2014-10-22,Decided to travel Business Class SGN-FCO-SGN last summer holidays (May/June 2014). The experience was great. Hubby and me + 3 kids aged 8 months 5 year-old and 9 year-old. All the crew were really helpful with the kids. They even allowed my baby to sleep on the unused seat. I cannot imagine how tedious it could be travellling with 3 kids but surprisingly everyone in my family was more than comfortable flying Qatar Airways. Will definitely use Qatar Airways again.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2096,2014-10-22,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Bernhard,Germany,2014-10-22,Fairly disappointed. First class seat was narrow (much smaller than others like LH LX on the same aircraft type). Crew not proactive need to request everything. Food mediocre (compared to Asian airlines in F) no pyjamas no F lounge in DOH (C lounge was relatively good food offerings look impressive but everything is pre-cooked and dried out. Entertainment system needed rebooting and was unreliable.,,First Class,,,no,,

2098,2014-10-13,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Geoff Harris,United Kingdom,2014-10-13,Qatar Airways has really gone downhill at least from the UK. I have flown with them several times to Asia over the last 8 years and it was OK but last week I went to Dubai via Doha. Unless I have got a lot bigger the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and designed so that when the person in front reclines you have hardly any room. The food was average too. Then I had only one hour to change at Doha and had to literally run to get my connecting flight to Dubai as the airport is quite big. Exhausting. On the way back the check in lady at Dubai told me the flight was quiet (it wasn't) and again the seats were really cramped so much so my leg ached. The inflight crew were bossy and you very much were made to feel like a second class citizen in Economy. They couldn't even serve you a cold beer. I will book Emirates next time.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2099,2014-10-13,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Browne Philip,United Kingdom,2014-10-13,Manchester - Doha business class plane was A330 in good condition. Seats were comfortable and everything worked as it should. We were greeted by name and cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Dine on demand but I was not impressed with the food offered although the wine on offer was very good. Took off on time and landed on time. Have travelled previously with Qatar and am a frequent flyer member but I feel that the level of service is slipping.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2101,2014-10-13,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,G Taylor,United Kingdom,2014-10-13,Edinburgh-Doha-Male return. Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy. All in all great experience and would have no hesitation flying Qatar on future trips.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Plane was fairly new clean and comfortable a good flight. DOH-LHR was supposed to be a B787 but was changed to an A340 with no notice. Originally selected 2 seats together (window and aisle) these were changed to 1 window and 1 middle row several rows away. Only found out at online check-in. Managed to get 2 seats together with negotiation with other passengers. Cabin staff did not assist. Return LHR-DOH again supposed to be a B787 was changed to a B777ER. Plane still OK but older. Again seats changed (2 together this time) with no notification and further back than originals. Food a little better than average and cabin staff attentive. Seat leg room good but seemed hard. Overall a good airline- Doha airport is big and roomy but few places to get coffee if you have a wait. No alcohol but that is expected.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Business class was full. Took off bang on time and was informed that dine on demand was available. When looking at the menu it seemed that there was only a choice of snacks or omelette and chicken sausage. Companions IFE did not work and had to be reset four times. For a seven hour flight I was very disappointed with the food offered. Flying to Thailand in February 2015 I will not be using Qatar for this journey.,,Business Class,,,no,,

Check-in in Hanoi and Bangkok smooth and excellent. Lounge access without problem (as gold card holder). Lounge in Hanoi suffer from dormant staff busy with own activities but the airport view is gorgeous and food is plenty though mainly industrial. Onboard recognized and nourished as gold member. New wines in economy and for the first time after 50 flights with QR they changed the beer to Foster from the usual Heineken. So a boring brand replaced by an even more boring brand. However hot snacks were tasty service on board excellent and caring. From BKK till Hanoi 3 days later I was upgraded to business class by 8 only Q-credits (from Privilege FF-Program). What a pleasure in the Airport as fast track gives you better service. The Lounge (they use Thai Airways lounges) was very spacious and quiet but no wines nor champagnes were offered. Food displayed nicely but hardly acceptable except for loads of Chinese dishes (all Chinese tend to go to Thailand these days as they are not welcomed in Vietnam). The QR flight (got seat 1K in a 2x2x2 configuration) and service onboard was very very good and matches that of a 5-stars airline as Qatar retains.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Seats are fine if you manage to avoid the numerous seats that have a box in the foot space. Entertainment system is old and tired. Better with your own tablet. Food basic.

2107,2014-10-01,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Woodhead,Thailand,2014-10-01,Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar. All in all Qatar is a good product.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Overall a very good product excepted the extra-low quality on food (snacks) served on board. A generous 30kg luggage allowance applies increased by extra 10kg offered to Gold Privilege Club members. New HIA Doha Airport is really efficient and comfortable also new Business Class lounge is really fantastic despite of a poor dining offer. Nothing you can compare with grotty Flydubai or Air Arabia's crockery.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2109,2014-10-01,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Patricia Carey,United States,2014-10-01,My husband and I flew a promotionally rated flight(s) from Chicago to Doha and onward to Dubai on 9/14. We then returned on an early flight from Dubai to Doha and back home to Chicago on 9/20. QA is a wonderful airline and we had lots of room in the 777 for our main flights. The flight coming back was packed and the crowd was kind of unruly to board. We were in the back of the plane so among the first to board other than people with kids and first class etc. It was a 14.5 hour trip from Doha to Chicago. A passenger behind us took it upon himself to to chastise my husband for reclining his seat back. We changed seats later as I prefer the aisle. The flight was (other than the passeger) was great - great service leg room entertainment and good food as well. All trips on QA were great.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2110,2014-09-28,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Priyanu Two,Germany,2014-09-28,QR060 MUC-DOH-BKK on 6 September. Boeing 787. I have flown Qatar Airways many times already and always have had a good experience. Started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. I asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until I had finished my dinner. The cabin crew said that they had been busy. I was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer. But my flight from Doha to Bangkok everything was excellent. Therefore on this occasion I would only give Qatar Airways 5 stars out of 10 on Trip Satisfaction.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2111,2014-09-19,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C W Li,United States,2014-09-19,Among world class airlines and its 5-star competitors like Cathay Pacific Qatar definitely holds its own. This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while. Overall worthy of being a top international airline and recommended. Will fly (am flying!) with them again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2112,2014-09-17,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Graubard,United States,2014-09-17,QR771 from GRU-EZE on 12 Sept. 777-200LR aircraft was in good condition. Boarding was organized with families with kids first and people with special needs. Then Business class and priority customers. The flight originates in Doha so there were people on-board already - they aren't required to disembark on the transit stop. Economy was around 80% full while Business looked 30-40% full. Flight attendants were great! Super friendly - handed out headphones and served a very good meal of either chicken or pasta. AVOD entertainment is fantastic - the 2 1/2 hour flight went by quickly. Bags were unloaded by the time you cleared immigration and I was in a taxi in 20 minutes after disembarking. Always love to travel on Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2113,2014-09-14,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ahmed Nash,Jordan,2014-09-14,QR401. AMM-DOH. Flight departed earlier than the scheduled time which was good because I had less than 1 hour to catch the next flight. However two young passengers seated next to me made me uncomfortable. They jumped stood on chairs played with their food annoyed the passenger in front of me cried crossed my seat just to peek into the window and my bag under the seat was nearly drenched in coffee. The food was ok (chicken potatoes green beans in soy sauce). Overall it was a nice flight. QR844 DOH-KUL. I had more than enough time to catch my next flight. It was not a full flight so I got the whole aisle row to myself. For the first time in my life I could lay down completely on a flight. The food was great (noodles again in soy sauce). The sandwich offered was OK. One of the FAs was nice we had a chat during boarding.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2115,2014-09-14,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Raj,United States,2014-09-14,We traveled from Philadelphia to Singapore this summer. Flights were enjoyable both ways. Crew was excellent but at times they get too comfortable and not attend to basics - my little one did not get a toy or anything though the attendant paid much attention to one family with a baby on our flight back from Doha to Philadelphia). The first issue we had was with the transit first leg it was about 19 hours Qatar Airways did not provide transit accommodation. We paid USD 125 each to get the transit accommodation (beware of the limitation of the allowance for Meals even with this paid service ours covered only 2 meals which was not that great in Swiss-belhotel) on the return journey it was an hour and a half with long walk between terminals to security check and back to gate there was no consideration for short transit passengers. Second issue was with food preference we had 2 vegetarian meals ordered which were not offered on way to Singapore though I had talked to Attendants they confirmed our meal preference; but asked me to talk to a Supervisor in one of transit gates who promised it will be corrected in other legs which did not help much. I will consider flying with them again due to convenience flying out from Philadelphia.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2116,2014-09-10,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Geno,United States,2014-09-10,Flew IAD-DOH-SHJ (Sharjah outside Dubai) during a promo sale in mid-May. Food quality and entertainment options were phenomenal. Movies were up to date and seat width and legroom was decent. Comfortable cabin atmosphere on the long-haul legs and good cabin service. My requests for snacks and ice cream were honored and added satisfaction to the flight. The repeated on-screen play of the menu was disruptive to IFE though. Appreciated the youth and gentleness of in-flight staff especially on the short-haul flights. Even the short-haul flights had delectable snacks. The only trouble was the since-decommissioned Doha International Airport was not sufficient to handle QR's busy network and operations. Had we not seen monitors in other parts of the airport we would have definitely missed our flights. QR's flights to/from the States tend to be pretty packed because of service to/from South Asia.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Late delivery 380 so changed to 777 no issue but downgraded to Biz. with no communication from Qatar of downgrade. Only found out when I checked reservation online. Speedy refund after contacting reservations. 787 also changed to 330 with the dreaded angled seat. LHR-DOH leg now changed again this time 340 angled seat. Resigned to the fact won't be getting much sleep. Never had problems with Qatar in the past. If I had known 340/330 combo with no flat bed would have booked SQ.

When fillet finally arrived it was tough and chewy and I couldnt eat. I couldnt even cut through. My Inflight Entertainment on one leg was not working. The movies are very old and very few new shows. The staff although very pleasant do not seem to be that helpful. The seats were very comfortable. I had to ask for pyjamas and no-one offered to put my fitted cover over seat. Good quality champagne what a waste. Overall very disappointing.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2119,2014-09-01,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S McLay,United Kingdom,2014-09-01,Flight from Edinburgh to Singapore via Doha. Seemed like an amazing price for business class both ways and on a 5 star airline. Flights out were on new planes and very comfortable however cabin crew were tiring always fussing; maybe that's 5 star treatment but I don't like it. Flight back was on a not so new plane from Doha to London and not very comfortable I'll stick with BA premium economy out and business back in the future as its cheaper and all in a better experience. My colleague went Emirates business for around the same price as Qatar Airways and reported a very good experience.,,Business Class,,,no,,

For most of the sectors Boeing 787-8 Jet and Boeing 777-300ER Jet were used. Those were superb flights with amazing facilities except QR 0660. Crew and flight attendants also were fairly good. Flight QR0660. It was like an old bus there was no AC when we were on board. One hour was taken to fix the AC. This flight must not be used for international service it should be used for domestic service. I started from North America via Europe Middle East to South Asia. We expect comfortable service throughout all sectors.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Although the plane was 11 years old it was new and clean inside. New touchscreen entertainment system many new films and a wide choices of films. Food was excellent however the cabin crew should smile more. DOH-LHR: A 7year old B777-300ER. Flight was delayed by about 30 minutes. Entertainment system was almost the same but it wasn't sensitive. Meal was not bad but the first sector was better. Excellent service the cabin crew smiled a lot. MAD-DOH: A 4 year old B777-300ER. Entertainment system was more sensitive. Excellent service and meal. Seat was comfortable and the legroom is good. Qatar Airways is my first choice when I go to Europe next time because of its 5 star service!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Put on the following day's flight and overnight in a hotel in Doha at no additional cost. Doha's new airport is stunning. I used the business lounge on the morning of my revised flight and it was spacious modern with great food. The flight in business to CPT was superb. Very comfortable seat in the new Dreamliner with excellent entertainment attentive staff and good food options. Highly recommended.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

IFE system worked properly and crew was welcoming but not very friendly just did their job. Special ordered meals were served but drinks were only served twice! Flight was on time. Second leg QR67 DOH-FRA on Airbus A330-300. Staff was welcoming and helpful. IFE did not work properly (crashed several times). Ordered meals were served but tasted horrible. Moreover the amount was much to less. Again drinks were only served twice (during breakfast and lunch). I felt a bit ignored by the crew when I wanted a third drink which in my opinion should be served on a flight of seven hours. Flight arrived on time in Frankfurt.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

The planes where all very clean we flew an A330 and B777. The seat quality was one of the best I have had. The biggest let down for me and why I will not be using Qatar again was because I am an emerald one world flyer I was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served I was asked again as my preference was no longer available. I explained I had made a previous order being an emerald member. This was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges. Doha airport is so much improved easy connections and very clean and professional.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2127,2014-08-11,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,T Berri,Italy,2014-08-11,MXP-DOH (A320 business): Flew the refurbished A320 with the new flat-seat beds. Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing. Furnished well but lacking in refreshment offerings; delays for transfers at DOH. Still will probably fly Qatar again if the opportunity arises.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2128,2014-08-08,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Khan Munawar,Pakistan,2014-08-08,Flew 2 sectors: Islamabad - Doha QR615 Doha - Manchester QR23. 1st sector on 773 - very clean and well maintained cabin excellent IFE and very welcoming and attentive cabin staff flight very smooth and superb landing at Doha. 2nd sector operated by A333 aircraft cabin clean and well maintained - comfort levels very good for a ~9 year old aircraft A7-EAH IFE acceptable needs upgrading. flight was smooth from take off on schedule to a normal landing before time. Arrival at gate was delayed by ~ 30 min for no fault of the airline rather due to a 'hoax' which was dealt with in an excellent manner by the authorities and exceptional professionalism demonstrated by the flight crew as well as the cabin crew. Only drawback was that the breakfast served on both sectors though well prepared was exactly the same.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2130,2014-08-06,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Alex Griggs,United Kingdom,2014-08-06,Flew LHR-DOH-RGN HND-DOH-LHR. The LHR-DOH was on a refurbished A330 so the flight was pleasant with a good sized IFE screen and a sufficient selection of films. However the letdown on this flight was the catering which was a running theme throughout all of the flights as well as the attitude of the cabin crew who looked as if they did not want to work. The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets. The crew also didn't help the flight by not smiling and ignoring the call button for passengers. All in all I was dissatisfied with Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.,,First Class,,,N/A,,
2134,2014-08-03,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Y Areemitr,United Kingdom,2014-08-03,LHR-DOH-BKK and back. All sectors operated by B777-300ER except DOH-LHR which was an A340 (old plane and really showed its age). QR have serious communication issues when it comes to being delayed and all flights (except the one leaving BKK) were delayed by at least 40 minutes if not more. Hamad international airport was nice and new but unfortunately very chaotic if you have a tight connection. Food was probably the best thing on QR - quite tasty for airline food! FA's really varied on each leg - some were just sitting/standing around chatting amongst themselves and were clearly not interested in customer service whereas others tried their best to deliver. Inflight entertainment was pretty good on 777s. Plenty to choose from but pretty much the same film/TV choices a month later and remote control on A340 stiff and unresponsive. Seats were a little on the uncomfortable side though lots of legroom compared to other carriers. The 2-4-2 config on the A340 definitely suited my companion and I more than the 777's 3-3-3 layout. Overall pretty average.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

2136,2014-08-03,1,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Jenni Goodman,United Kingdom,2014-08-03,On 24/7/2014 I travelled Business Class from Melbourne to London Heathrow via Doha. The first leg of the journey on QR905 was relatively OK but on arriving at Doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight I went to the business class lounge where I was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. I was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. The flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. The service on board was OK but the toilets were not cleaned. My monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. I feel very aggrieved that I paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment - I have yet to receive a response to my email from Qatar Airways.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2137,2014-07-31,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,K Chhan,Cambodia,2014-07-31,"My family and I flew PNH-Manchester then CDG-PNH both with technical stops in HCM and transit in DOH. Generally speaking the inflight service was good but the food on all 4 sectors was bad. Passengers on all 4 flights were mostly Westerners and Westernised Asians like my family and yet the food was quite Indian Middle-eastern - oriented relatively spicy. I know that one should not expect too much from airline food but having flown on many airlines around the world I expected more from an airline that positions itself as ""the 5-star airline"". Likewise it's a shame that Qatar has just inaugurated a state-of-the art airport in DOH but Qatar Airways ground staff in DOH failed to implement universal policies that are clearly advertised in their Website e.g. to give priority boarding to passengers accompanied by young children.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2138,2014-07-29,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Louise De Villiers,South Africa,2014-07-29,Three of us flew between Cape Town and Casablanca via Doha in July 2014. The ticket price was very good. The leg from Cape Town and Doha on a new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent. The airport in Doha is brand new and there are excellent facilities for transit passengers. The flight from Doha to Casablanca was problematic. There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft. The latter surfaced when the aircraft dropped passengers off in Johannesburg and had to depart to Cape Town. The food was average. Especially the light snacks were unsatisfactory. The crew members were very helpful and professional.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Last week I took Qatar Airways for the first time Madrid to Bangkok via Doha. The experience was the best business class experience I have had. The seats are very comfortable and the space between seats the largest I have seen in a business class cabin. It is true that the layout does not give you much privacy if you are traveling alone. The service and the food were excellent especially on the Doha to Bangkok flight. The only downturn was the Doha airport lounges were not available. We were given 300 Qr vouchers for food and shopping which was quite nice. Overall excellent experience.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Firstly the positives both flights were fine although at Doha on the BKK sector flight we waited on the aircraft for more than an hour without the APU running so very hot. HBE to DOHA half empty DOHA to BKK very full. There were lots of free upgrades in Business can tell by the yellow luggage tag. Qatar should vet upgrades carefully as these people walked around without shoes and were generally noisy. Doha Lounges are a total mess that is an understatement. No room poor food service very poor. No pre boarding for Business class just get with the rest attitude. I would not use Qatar again until they sort out the new airport.,,First Class,,,no,,

Munich-Doha on 787 was excellent with great seating and service limited meal choice. Doha- Kochi upgraded to first as economy over sold and all bumped up one grade. Poor service and check in facilities in Kochi on return. Business seat very uncomfortable similar to Aer lingus who are currently changing. Doha-LHR business on 340-600 instead of original listed 380. No lounge available in Doha tried to pay for upgrade due to poor seating in business no paid upgrade available.

QR837 BKK-DOH overnight. Business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. FA screwed up my breakfast (so I got none). Flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges which required an additional blanket to soften. Meals were minuscule. I understand small portions on an overnight flight but if you are hungry you are out of luck. I'd heard so much about the fabulous first and business class lounge in DOH. I must be in the wrong place (even though I have been told by two staff that this is the only QR lounge in the airport). What a disappointment. No particularly comfortable seating very little privacy meagre drink and food offerings no organized system for getting a shower - seems to be catch-as-catch- can. I wonder if their famous premier lounge I'd heard so much about is under renovation or something. I expected much more than this.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2144,2014-07-20,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Harish Jagannath,United States,2014-07-20,My family did a European tour so we flew HYD-DOH-LHR and on the return FCO-DOH-HYD. First the flights between HYD-DOH are single aisle on A321 feels cramped IFE is just passable but food was a big let down. We arrived at the brand new Hamad International airport so the airport experience was excellent although very quiet. On flights between DOH and LHR (on A340-600) and FCO-DOH (on A330-300) there was a problem with the air conditioning at DOH so it was like an oven until the flight took off to LHR. In FCO the flight was parked in the middle of nowhere so the boarding experience was terrible. IFE was a shocker - no touchscreens and an inspiring collection of movies and shows. The food was terrible. On the bright side cabin crew were friendly the seat configuration and space factor was really comfortable. Again on the down side: no mood lighting no hot towel no menu card and plastic spoons and forks is not what I expect from a five-star airline.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2145,2014-07-20,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,H Zhang,China,2014-07-20,I flew from London Heathrow to Guangzhou Baiyun. The trip was the best economy class long-haul flight I have had. Starting from check in I checked in online the night before my trip. At the airport the ground staff who checked me in were very friendly. Because I had a short transfer flight to catch 1.5 hours after handing in Doha they put a label of rapid transfer on my checked in luggage. The first flight from Heathrow to Doha only 30% of the economy class were seated and basically every passenger had a row to lie down. The dining service was great cabin crews were extremely nice even though you ask them to get you another drink several times they didn't have any printed forms of menu they present you a menu on your personal IFE screen. The flight to Guangzhou was pretty much the same but with less choice of food and more crowded.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2146,2014-07-17,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,I Orosz,Australia,2014-07-17,BKK-DOH-EDI and LHR-DOH-BKK. First leg was on 777-300 then 787 and 319 from LHR. Service is first class. Seat is wide and comfortable only thing was that they did not provide any mattresses so the seat was sometimes a bit hard. The 319 from London is an excellent experience along with the impressive LHR Lounge. Overall Qatar Airways service is very impressive.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2147,2014-07-13,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Gordon S McDougall,Thailand,2014-07-13,As frequent flyer from Azerbaijan to SE Asia and Australasia over the last 15 years I'm delighted that Qatar now fly from Baku cutting out the change in carriers. Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers. If Emirates started flying into GYD tomorrow you'd lose me and most of my fellow passengers.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2148,2014-07-13,1,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S McNeill,United Kingdom,2014-07-13,I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2149,2014-07-06,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Pierre Jean Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2014-07-06,DXB-DOH-CDG. June 26th afternoon flight. New Hamad Intl Airport was most welcome for this Ramadan travel back to Europe. QR lounge for Glad and Silver transit passengers in Economy still not available but this glitch has been compensated with 5.000 Qmiles and a $30 gift voucher. Good staff on both leg but food was inedible (Chinese style fried beef with rice and vegetables) just like in a bad canteen. Nice beverage selection and great staff however despite a very rude hostess on DOH-CDG leg. 77W equipment was also highly appreciated.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2150,2014-07-06,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Charles Kennedy,United Kingdom,2014-07-06,LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg. Both flights on time.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2152,2014-07-03,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,SzeKer Chew,Malaysia,2014-07-03,Pleasant trip for both outgoing (KUL-DOH-MAN) and incoming trip (LHR-DOH-KUL). For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers. They would do their best to fulfil the request and they eventually did most of the time. I will go for Qatar Airways again!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2153,2014-07-03,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Jose Montoya,United States,2014-07-03,MLE-DOH-JFK: The MLE-DOH segment was on an A320 (my least favorite aircraft) but the First class configuration was brilliant and extraordinarily comfortable. I am die hard Boeing individual but the 4+ hours on this airbus were great due to the comfortable seat great service and absolutely seamless experience flying Qatar was in this segment. From DOH to JFK I was on a 777-300. Honestly every star given to this airline is clearly deserved. Staff are professional. Great entertainment (but now even horrible American carriers have it) and yes kudos on the right temperature of food and champagne (concept foreign to all American carriers).,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

After reading many less favourable reviews on Qatar Airways we feared the trip when we were delayed at Cape Town before even embarking. However a pleasant crew outstanding service a well maintained Boeing 787 an on time landing in Doha changed our views. The transfer was quick and easy and the onward flight to Barcelona as good as the first. We will follow the route again!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

The first plane was an Airbus 330 with Lie flat seats. The service was fantastic! The seats were extremely comfortable the monitor was quite large. Everything about this flight was wonderful. Next segment was on a B777-300 and the seats had even more room! Fantastic lie flat beds excellent service. They don't feed you like they used to but the meals were fine service was very good. I would highly recommend this airline and service. You had tons of movies to choose from that were all recent releases as well as some older ones. The inflight entertainment system was very good. The monitors were at least 16”. They offered me pyjamas on the second leg to change into they provided very nice pillows and blankets on both flights as well as a nice amenity kit.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2156,2014-07-01,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Aplas,South Africa,2014-07-01,13/14 June 2014. CPT-DOH-LCA. First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey. Luckily flight was only half full so I had an entire row to myself. Extremely good fare on entire trip.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Appeared to be a very old plane seats were hardly much better than economy hardly any foot room I am rather a large person (which is why I chose Business class) but the seat belt didn't fit table wouldn't come down across my stomach TV was too uncomfortable to watch and anyway my earphones didn't work (seat 1A) so very glad it was only a 4 hour 50 minute flight. I couldn't eat anything as the table was too uncomfortable. The Flight crew were very pleasant though so pleased I was transferring to a 777 at Doha I couldn't have stood being in that plane for any longer. The onward flight to Melbourne was amazing and would recommend Qatar for Doha/Melbourne leg (unlucky I got that aircraft I guess).,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The first leg was First class on an Airbus 321. Small aircraft and got shaken a round a bit during fine weather. The service was outstanding. Only 2 people and a family. The cabin supervisor went out of his way to please us. No Alcohol on the first leg. The second leg fro Doha to Bangkok was again exceptional service. The food was hot of and extremely high quality by any restaurant standard yet alone up in the air at 39000 feet! The cabin staff were pleasant always had a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Both the supervisors and staff on both legs should be commended for their efforts. The new airport was a pleasant surprise with no buses. No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace. Hats off to the entire experience. I will choose no other airline if it flies the route I am taking. The new airport is big and will take some getting used to.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2161,2014-06-23,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Upton,Australia,2014-06-23,A real mixed bag - some staff friendly and courteous with good English language skills and some staff having none of the three and being flat out rude. Most planes do not have enough toilets on board with long queues being common. Food standard quite decent for a plane but drinks service is not nearly frequent enough. I waited two hours during a flight for someone to come past with the little drinks tray that they usually provide and in the end had to push the call button to get a drink! It took them 10 minutes from the button being pushed to arrive. The amenities kit is excellent with the ear plugs being a rare and thoughtful addition. Not sure I would fly again not with so many other options available for similar money.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

All on 777 apart from Barcelona-Doha on 330. 777 comfortable and great seat pitch. 330 comfortable but entertainment remote in awkward position in armrest. Flights on time. Crew generally very pleasant and reasonably efficient. Food from Perth to Doha lovely. Then breakfast on arrival and departure from Doha which were fine but nothing special. Food on both return flights really not good didn't eat much of it which is not like me! Strangely didn't mind the old airport too much this time despite the long bus trips. Returned through the new Hamad airport which seems like a big improvement especially the aerobridges but didn't really feel fully finished seemed like half of the lights still weren't functioning yet. Overall a reasonably pleasant trip especially given the good price we got the tickets for.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2165,2014-06-16,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-06-16,SGN-DOH-NBO on 14 June 2014. Metal was A330-200 and A320 respectively. Both flights on time. Lounge access granted in SGN and DOH due to my status card to the airline. Got the seat I wanted and when on board I got assistance by FA to remove intruders encroaching my row. Opportunity to flat out on both sectors. A dinner served after midnight was of poor quality (warm snack) but edible. Champagne offered in economy class upon request. Staff alert and welcoming. New airport in Hamad Doha is still a mess too many staff that don't know how to help lots of bottlenecks too few toilets too few lounges (many pax denied access due to fully crowded lounges). Those denied were given “gift-vouchers” which force them to queue up for long time to actually get them. Many regional flights and “small destinations like NBO are still not accessed directly by gates but require the usual awful humiliating imprisoning bus-rides. QR are still delivering FA and ground staff are world class. However the food quality is sliding a bit and the concept on board could need some refreshing. No choice on beers. Wines are acceptable and provide 4 choices plus champagne on some sectors.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

The 787 that flew us from Singapore to Doha was brand new and very comfortable. The long flight from Doha to Sao Paulo was comfortable too. The flight didn't feel long as we were sleeping quite comfortably and there were lots of TV programs/movies to tie us through. Much more comfortable than we thought. Both flights have USB charging point so you can charge phones/laptops. Crews were friendly. The seat that I was on (Doha-Sao Paulo) had faulty inclination though it couldn't sit straight. Would be good if such defects were rectified prior to the long flight as I could not sit upright during take off and the stewardess thought that I didn't follow the instruction.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2168,2014-06-12,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Al-Ani Ayad,Austria,2014-06-12,Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good.

The seat pitch was bad. Not comfortable. The IFE was ancient. The control was fixed in the arm rest so navigation was hard and you had to press it hard a few times in order for it to function. The Hollywood selection was good but the world cinema choices were poor. The food was exactly the same as I had 2 years before on the very same flight. It was tasteless. The crew were good just did what they had to. The flight from Doha to Amritsar was much better on a new Airbus A321. IFE was faster and easier to use but same movies. Arrived on time in India. On the return the flight was overbooked at Amritsar and after much confusion was put on Air India which was surprisingly better than Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand. I travelled with a colleague who was flying Qatar for the first time I doubt he will fly them again because of the airport experience. Really was a major let down.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Return got to gate and aircraft still boarding but told I was disconnected as baggage would not make it. 6 hour wait as next LHR flight also delayed. Connection time was 50 minutes on ticket yet told unless 40 minutes free cannot make connection. Why sell a ticket leaving a 10 minute space to make a connection. New airport too big and had to run 1/2 mile at least to get to next flight. Rude ground staff who have no idea how the new terminal works.

Seat configuration is different but good on both - flat beds but more space on the 787. Both flights were delayed in departure - not so impressive. But the big letdown was the food! IT was (apart from KLM business) the worst business class food I have ever had! Stodgy unimaginative and dull.

Charming and helpful cabin crew great entertainment (especially appreciate being able to view while landing). One point though: please don't run the menu for 45 minutes - 5 minutes will suffice!

2175,2014-06-02,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Modak Sanjay,United Arab Emirates,2014-06-02,JFK to DWC via DOH. Managed to get first row economy bulkhead seats for self and wife. Found myself sitting next to some sort of bodybuilder guy whose biceps extended over into my space. When they announced all pax on board we swiftly moved over to the centre three seats and took up aisle positions with the centre seat empty. Flight was decent but the IFE was abysmal. Poor choice of movies and entertainment. We were among the first to transit the new airport in Doha - thank goodness no more buses! Marked improvement over the existing airport. At JFK we got 5K miles extra because the Silver lounge was not ready yet but we used our HSBC Premier cards to get into the Oryx lounge. Decent service clean cabins and bathrooms maintained well.

2176,2014-06-02,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Reeh,Australia,2014-06-02,On 4th May I flew from Melbourne to Manchester via Doha with Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways is affiliated with One World so lounge access is provided at Melbourne Airport by Qantas always a good way to start a long journey. The plane for the first sector was a brand new Boeing 777 and on a full flight I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of room in economy. I am 6ft 3in (189cms) and I could stretch out quite comfortably without touching the seat in front. I was sat in 23K. In flight entertainment was excellent with Premiere release movies and a host of documentaries to help while the hours away (all 14 hrs and 15 minutes for the first sector). Service and inflight catering was excellent with a good choice of food and regular water runs by the cabin crew. Landing in Doha was probably the only negative as the airport was packed and hectic. With a tight transit time of just 60 minutes I was fearing the worst but somehow it all seemed to happen and I made the connection. The second sector of 7hrs and 30 minutes was completed in an Airbus A330 which was notably smaller and older than the Boeing 777. However the service was on par and food and entertainment options again superior. All in all a pleasant experience for what is a gruelling distance to fly. Qatar Airways deserve the recognition and commendations they win on a regular basis. Highly recommended.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2177,2014-06-02,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Derek Gilboe,Saudi Arabia,2014-06-02,Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers; unfortunately they face ground staff issues at several airports that frustrate during the boarding and deplaning process. The new airport in Doha their primary hub is open but facing considerable growing pains and still relies on buses for many airport transits. Coupled with insufficient lounge space particularly for their premium customers significantly compromises the overall trip experience and turns their new flagship airport in Doha to a frustrating experience that undermines the excellent in-flight service and value for the money in the competitive market of air travel.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

I was in row 8 so had a nice amount of leg room. IFE was a little unresponsive but since the flights were short it wasn't a problem. Food was up to the usual QR standard and cabin crew were friendly and professional as usual. Second leg was an A333. had an aisle seat so leg space was restricted due to the IFE box under the seat in front. IFE kept sticking but since it was a night flight I slept most of the journey. Crew were friendly and professional as the usual standard. Catering was just OK on this leg. The new airport makes transiting a breeze.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2179,2014-06-02,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Simon Lehmann,Switzerland,2014-06-02,Zurich to Doha and Doha to Narita on May 29-30. Was traveling with my wie and children (3 and 5). At the check-in we got the information that we can't access the lounge at the new Doha airport. For this reason we got a voucher which could be changed into vouchers at Doha airport. The flight from Zurich to Doha was one hour delayed. We didn't get any proper information. The departure time was shifted every 15 minutes. Once on board was surprised about the comfort in the cabin. The food and drinks were excellent. The service onboard was average. At Doha airport they were not really ready. Very long queue at the security check. Asked for business class fast track. Was not available. Then had to walk quite a long way for the connecting gate. We were flying from gate B1A. That meant we had to take a bus to the plane but first we had to wait outside for the bus. Once at the plane we had to wait outside again before we could enter. Flight was ok. Food again excellent and the service was better than from Zurich to Doha.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2180,2014-06-02,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-06-02,BUD-DOH-SGN on 28-29 May 2014. Aircraft's A321 and A330-200 respectively. All flights on time. No queues in any counters as there were plenty open. Ground staff in BUD were extremely attentive and co-operative and assisted me fully dealing with a luggage problem (my luggage only arrived to Hungary when I was due to depart after a weeks stay). WiFi not available. What was stunning was their excellent co-operation on this with the competing carrier TK. I was from BUD without demands upgraded from the cheapest possible economy ticket to business class to DOH. The cabin was almost full (10 seats of 12 taken) but service was top-notch despite I was initially not expected to be in the business class. Champagne has changed from Jackquart to Lanson. Food very good. Seats not lie flat but no much need to lie down on a day flight? Doha Hamad Airport is still in its infantry but service desks are all over the place to make up for faults. Arrived to be taken to the gates by the busses which was a first disappointment. The lounges are not fully operating: very few and crowded and short of meat-dishes showers and sparkling wine. WiFi is operating. DOH-SGN: Boarding directly from gate to aircraft ! A huge improvement from the old airport. Upgraded at gate despite aircraft was only 30% full. Champagne choice extended to include the Taittinger rose. Good food. Only 4 seats of 24 were occupied. FAs good though could have been a bit more observant/proactive. But they were all professional and comprehending. A pleasure to lie down on the seats.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2182,2014-05-26,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Doug Caldwell,United States,2014-05-26,London to Doha Boeing 787. Qatar Airways sets the standard for luxury business class with this airplane and it was the best experience I've had in many years. First class lounge at Heathrow Terminal was fantastic fabulous good great wines and nice staff. Onboard the airplane brilliant business class cabin and nice color scheme. I had a single window seats and truly private - better than most airlines first class. Meals served individually table style and food was good with a great selection of wines. Staff very efficient they don't smile much though but are courteous. The in flight entertainment had massive choice of movies and tv programs. Downside was arrival into Doha with long bus ride but the new airport is flagged to open this week and that will top this off as the best business class out there.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2183,2014-05-26,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Sandy Shi,United States,2014-05-26,BOS-HKG via Philadelphia and Doha. When we arrived in Philadelphia we needed new boarding passes so went to the Qatar Airways counter for them. The attendant said that there was something wrong with our ticket boarding passes cannot be issued and only US Airways can fix the problem. She sent us to the US Airways counter without telling us what was the issue. We went over stood in line for 45 minutes waited for someone. Of course nothing was wrong. We went back to Qatar Airways for sure the issue had cleared and we were all set to board. We wasted over 90 minutes for no apparent reason. Philadelphia to Doha was delayed severely due to a bathroom issue. Doha Airport itself was small and messy with the new Hamad Airport opening 27 May it will probably get better. HKG-DOH with Cathay Pacific we were upgraded to Premium Economy free due to overbooking. The seat was very comfortable. The in flight entertainment system was more responsive compared to Qatar Airways. DOH-PHL I slept through most of the flight and my husband most of the flight. I don't recommend this airline unless you are flying business or first class where Qatar Airways actually value you.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2184,2014-05-26,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Shamin,South Africa,2014-05-26,JNB-DOH-BCN return. All flights on time early into JNB on return home. All flights on newish aircraft comfortable seats and nice meals. Staff on night flight were not present in the cabin as much as I would expect but the rest was nice and attentive. Doha airport was bearable and quite quick connections both ways but can't wait for their new airport to finally open. Didn't use the IFE myself but my partner was impressed and watched endless choice of movies.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2185,2014-05-26,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Harding,United Arab Emirates,2014-05-26,AUH-DOH-LHR return. 90 minutes delay at DOH waiting for late connections/congestion. Things will improve with the new airport opening 27th May 2014. The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. Missed connections at DOH for myself and others and the horror of the Doha Airport transfer desk. Only the attendants on the first leg welcomed me onboard as a Gold Card holder.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2186,2014-05-26,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,F Paul,Australia,2014-05-26,1st time flying with Qatar. Flights were from Perth to Dusseldorf. The flight was OK food was enjoyable but the list of inflight movies where old and not that many. All announcements where done in both English and Arabic which get annoying especially the videos of the same safety procedures interrupting the in-flight entertainment. All flights were delayed some by over 1 hour which does not help with tight connections. Missed our flight from Berlin to Dusseldorf for which they took over an hour to get us on the next flight which we almost missed again. Lost our luggage as well at least it turned up the next day. Our return flights were also delayed. It may have been cheaper but Singapore Air does it best. Also Doha airport is not great at all.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2187,2014-05-26,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Eu Jin Song,Malaysia,2014-05-26,As a frequent flier who travels on business on average of once a month I was rather disappointed to note the poor quality of the cabin crew on both legs of my recent Business Class flight onboard Qatar Airways. The crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. Overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives I obtained from a good lounge in Doha and efficient check in service.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2188,2014-05-23,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-05-23,NBO-DOH-BUD on 19 May 2014. All flights on time. Check-in was done well - I had two tickets and 4 sectors in front of me – only the first 2 sectors were with Qatar Airways but they managed to issue all 4 boarding cards thus the last two sectors were with Turkish who are in Star-alliance. Also the luggage was checked through beyond Budapest –- a nice touch. First leg on A320 night flight load only 60% - thus offered 3 seats in a row. Nice touch is that they offered 3 options of dinners (instead of breakfast) thus the clock was 2 am. I had red-marinated sea-bass as 1st main-course and as there were plenty of food left as many were sleeping I had rice and chicken as a 2nd main-course. Staff were proactive and I was greeted by name again by at least 4 FAs. Wines in mini-bottles and of reasonable quality. DOH-BUD A321. Flight full except 1 seat next to me. I was greeted and respected as Privilege Club Gold Card holder. Morning flight with 3 options of hot food. I chose the vegetarian omelette. Champagne Jacquart upon request. Juices and coffee ad libitum. I was explained by the chief purser on QRs new booking system which make it possible to combine tickets and transfer luggage across airlines many sectors and different alliances. IFE good though my monitor froze an hour before landing.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2189,2014-05-18,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,U Colombo,South Africa,2014-05-18,CPT-DOH-MXP-DOH-CPT. Big surprise was QR122 MXP-DOH on A320-200 aircraft where the old uncomfortable seat have been replaced with lie-flat ones! Well done Qatar Airways being a six hours night flight it made a difference. DOH-CPT on new Boeing Dreamliner was a good one. Pity a technical glitch kept us on the tarmac in Johannesburg for an extra three hours with little said from the captain. Overall a positive experience with a competent and professional cabin crew.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2190,2014-05-17,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Peter Otto,Germany,2014-05-17,MUC-CRK-MUC. Flight was very very good. In time good Entertainment system. Only point: I flew at night. I had to wait long until they served dinner and I could get a nap.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2191,2014-05-12,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Khan Muhammad,United States,2014-05-12,I flew on a connection from JFK-FCO-DOH-LHE. The ticket was a combination of Alitalia and Qatar. Excellent flight from JFK with Alitalia very impressed with their new business class. Of course when I arrived in Rome it was the traditional European lounge which was decent for a 3 hour layover. I have been flying Qatar for the past 6 years now. As soon as the flight was announced for boarding I didn't pay attention at that time Qatar airways ground staff came and assisted me to the aircraft with a very friendly attitude. The moment I entered the cabin they knew who I was and escorted me to my seat. The cabin manager then came introduced herself to me and thanked me for being their loyal Qatar Airways member. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were very friendly. 7 hours journey great food great hospitality. Landed at Doha Airport again separate terminals for First and Bus class passengers was treated very well and acknowledged by everyone for my membership status. Took a shower in the lounge and 2 hours later boarded for LHE. Again great service till LHE and enjoyed every minute of my flight. Etihad and Emirates should learn from Qatar Airways. Looking forward to their new Airport soon.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2192,2014-05-12,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Zelda Gilpin,South Africa,2014-05-12,I flew 4 long flights with Qatar Airways. Their staff are friendly and helpful. The seats are comfortable and have enough leg-room. The food was tasty and more than enough. The entertainment on board is some of the best. Even the help at the airport was great we never worried about getting to the right place. Qatar even booked a hotel room for us at a 5 star hotel at no extra cost as we had a long stop-over in Doha. This was really great as we could have a shower to freshen up and have a quick rest in a comfortable bed. I will recommend Qatar Airways to anyone.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2193,2014-05-11,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Mercer,United Kingdom,2014-05-11,LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airways’ policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a ‘VVIP’ which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience – the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the ‘World’s 5-star airline’ but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2194,2014-05-11,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,T Vernet,France,2014-05-11,CDG-DOH-NRT return. Y class. QR deserves its five stars. FAs were always smiling very helpful and some of them truly friendly. Extra drinks I ordered were never forgotten. Food was above average for Y class. IFE is excellent with dozens of films and lots of languages to choose from. But I was most of all impressed by the DOH-NRT flights on B777-200: the planes were brand new seats very comfortable with good legroom the cabin is small and stylish for Y IFE perfect food very tasty from NRT and the crew largely Japanese were fantastic as well as the ground staff at NRT. Without doubt the best Y flight I made in many years. On the downside A340 were ageing organisation of meals was often weird (too short or kept for too long) temperature in the cabin was curiously always badly managed (too hot or too cold) and most of all Doha's airport is awfully crowed and dull. New airport will be a major improvement.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2195,2014-05-11,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,L De los Reyes,Qatar,2014-05-11,Flew from Doha - Hong Kong via airbus A330. I will definitely try to avoid this aircraft of Qatar the aircraft was an old one based on the looks and the seat was really uncomfortable. I sat on the pillow and blanket just to make it feel better. The inflight entertainment isn't as entertaining as before.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2196,2014-05-08,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Walker,United Kingdom,2014-05-08,Very good service providing the price. Staff are very helpful and very attentive to any request you put to them. Entertainment was good but kept disconnecting / freezing during the flight but was always fixed. On our connecting flight from Doha to DXB the rear toilets were not in use and the door kept slamming open during the flight. Overall I would use Qatar again considering the price.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2197,2014-05-06,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Coleman,Thailand,2014-05-06,HBE-DOH First Class Airbus 320. Usual high quality afforded to me. Food and beverages very good staff attentive. Flight out personal DVD but limited films Flight back Personal TV with usual high selection of movies.

2198,2014-05-05,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Seran Karunaharan,Canada,2014-05-05,We flew last month from SIN-DOH-YUL sectors. It was a very long flight. The check-in at Changi airport was really smooth and the check in staff were really quick and helpful. The inflight meals and service were exceptional. Qatar Airways proves again and again why its a 5-star airline mostly due to their customer service cabin service and exceptional professionalism. The kids really loved the IFE inflight service and the caring staff. The transit at DOH was pretty quick and the next flight to YUL was a long one again. The cabin staff and the inflight service made our long journey a very relaxing one and enjoyable one. Hats off to Qatar airways staff. I would definitely fly Qatar airways again in the future.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2199,2014-05-05,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Morgan,United Kingdom,2014-05-05,"We travel LHR-JNB or LHR-CPT regularly usually on Emirates British Airways or South African but this was our first time on Qatar travelling LHR-JNB via Doha. Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed; by 50 minutes on the return leg and by 55 minutes on the outbound 50 of which were spent sitting the tarmac. Doha airport is a mess with a quite long ""luxury"" bus trip from the Arrivals and the Premium Transfer Terminal. The Qatar lounge in the Premium Terminal at Doha is good if rather large and impersonal and Qatar use the Shongolo Lounge at JNB which is pretty good although a little in need of decoration at the far end near the windows. All-in-all Qatar was reasonably good and the flights were 30% cheaper than Emirates BA and SAA but we probably won't be flying with them again.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2200,2014-04-29,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Wilson,Hong Kong,2014-04-29,Hong Kong - Madrid via Doha. Three of the planes were far too hot the food was dire especially the breakfasts each flight was delayed and changing planes in Doha airport is horrendous with incredibly long bus journeys to the terminals and then a madly cramped terminal to deal with. The air hostesses were mixed with two flights being fine but one flight having a very angry hostess. I'm going back to Air China Etihad and Emirates for long haul to Europe.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2201,2014-04-28,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Farhana Mustafa,Singapore,2014-04-28,Flew with my family FRA-DOH then DOH-SIN two days later. We were travelling with our 7 month old baby. Check-in agent in FRA and DOH were both serious and seemed unhappy to have us at their counter. Both did not give any eye contact when they spoke to us. They were very much focused on assigning the seats for us and our baby. Also the food tray for one of our seats was not cleaned and had some food stains on it. But apart from this all else was excellent. They accommodated our 7 pieces of luggage FAs were attentive and were constantly present throughout the flight. Food was fantastic especially on the DOH-SIN leg. I couldn't get enough of their IFE (so much to choose from). Seats were very comfortable and on the FRA-DOH leg they ensured seats around us were free so that we have plenty of room for our baby. Can't say the same for our experience at DOH airport though. But will not comment about that here.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

They separated 6 of us without any reason. Flight was delayed 30 minutes lunch service was very late. Doha airport was busy: they called for boarding went down to the ground floor the bus had still not come we have to wait 30 minutes in a small room with limited seating and without air conditioning. QR 844 use B777-3ER this flight was much better. Still no hot towel in the morning.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

The leg between Stockholm and Doha was particularly good in one of the new Dreamliners with champagne being served in economy class to mention one of the many positive things.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2204,2014-04-24,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Hippe,Germany,2014-04-24,KTM-DOH-FRA in March. Business Class. Very bad and unorganized crew on flight KTM-DOH. Took ages to serve a drink. Dinner service started as all passengers in economy had nearly finished. My choice was no longer available. Nearly all passengers upgraded from economy. Still recommend because of the really excellent crew on flight DOH-FRA and the high level of service received here. Angled lie flat seats only not very comfortable. Both flights delayed aircraft change from Dreamliner to old A330.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2205,2014-04-23,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Bowen,Switzerland,2014-04-23,Phnom Penh - Nice. Service onboard is superb. Fine food great choice of movies and excellent service as a whole although when plane is full service tends to be slow. The problem with Qatar is the transfers in Doha. It is from another age and the new airport which was supposed to be finished by 2012 is not yet in service. Thus you have to climb stairs to get into the plane and have a 20 minute ride on the tarmac before getting to the lounge areas. Still one of the best flying experience of my life. Will fly again with them when they have their new airport ready.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Flights between Doha and Warsaw and Vienna and Doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. Midnight flight out of MEL thought I would be able to sleep for the first part - wrong. Hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. Cabin crew don't insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. No foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of DOH on return sleeping when meal came so didn't get any drinks/meal until 2 hrs before landing in MEL. Toilets only two per section not cleaned often enough one was out of all paper products long queues.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2207,2014-04-19,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-04-19,SGN-DOH-NBO on 17-18 April 2014. Airbus 330 and 320 respectively. Check-in in Saigon polite but the staff (outsourced by QR to local company) at check-in was very inexperienced and pedantic and insisted on seeing onwards tickets visa etc so it took me 15 minutes at the counter. Flights punctual and service on top. All my personal preferences (seating food drinks) were accommodated. From Saigon I got an excellent dinner including 3 alternative options offered. I had a fish meal of very high class. Wines served from large bottles and several choices including champagne. IFE worked well. I was offered an upgrade to business class for 700 USD which I eventually declined though tempted. The dreadful bus-shuttling at Doha airport takes some credit away from my score for overall rating. Lounge access (gold card) smooth. DOH-NBO a bit more modest on-board service but still 3 options for dinner. Luggage arrived smoothly.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2208,2014-04-16,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Pierre-Jean Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2014-04-16,"CDG-DOH-DWC flown April 16th. CDG-DOH was overall a good flight however check-in at CDG was very chaotic and police control was a mess. Other big black point: the ""Icare"" lounge at CDG 1 with no showers nor private toilets. Equipment was an A340-600 which was pretty dirty. A real shame. The saving grace was the good service on-board. For a change transfer at DOH was a breeze and Oryx Lounge was really appreciable. DOH-DWC: messy flight with rude and unprofessional Moroccan hostesses only Chef de Cabine did her best. DWC Al Maktoum airport seems to be a big joke.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Same thing happened on LHR to DOH leg on 3rd April. Both times communication poor. DOH to LHR leg staff abrupt lunch service didn't start until 4.30pm (2.5 hours into flight) and was slow. I was bypassed both at drinks service and lunch and had to ask for drinks and my meal. There was no duty free service. The cabin crew seemed very inexperienced and flustered towards the end of the flight. All in all very poor.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2210,2014-04-15,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,N Madden,France,2014-04-15,Flew FRA to Singapore via Doha. First leg FRA-DOH was not pleasant packed with uncomfortable seats. DOH-SIN got better as they transferred me to a bulkhead seat. Return was not bad. Major issue seems to be Doha airport both inbound flights were late arriving and transfer takes an age leaving you running to the gate to get the connection. Another frustration is lack of options when trying to pick your seat on-line in advance. Next time I would probably go back to Emirates-Dubai.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2211,2014-04-14,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,O Omar,United Arab Emirates,2014-04-14,Flew CAI-DXB via DOH. First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares. Overall a good experience despite the old A330-200s which should get refitted as soon as possible. QR offers a 40kg baggage allowance ex Cairo and a choice of up to three departures from Cairo making them a convenient and reliable airline.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2212,2014-04-14,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Larsen,Norway,2014-04-14,QR 650 on 7 April Doha - KTM. Kathmandu- Doha- Colombo and return. We a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids do at least 4 international return trips a year - including 2 business class long haul flights. I have flown Qatar business class once but after this last flight our preferred airline is going to stay Thai - both for the better airport quality and the much better quality and service onboard and on the ground. Qatar flights were late both to and from Kathmandu our baggage did not connect on the outbound and ground staff in Doha claimed our almost empty hand luggage to be too big. I noticed the overhead bins on the flight were pretty empty.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2213,2014-04-13,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,C Allinson,United Kingdom,2014-04-13,LHR-PVG via Doha and then PEK-LHR via Doha again. These flights were the cheapest on the market when I purchased them in January and having had my first experience with Qatar last year I was delighted to book these flights for £450. 3 of the flights were on the B777 with the fourth being on the B787 Dreamliner. I had a window seat for all flights but would not book another window seat on the Dreamliner - there is a metal box just where your leg closest to the window should be! I was lucky in that I was sitting next to a waif of a girl who only required about 1cm of leg space so I was able to stretch my legs into her space. Service was good and food was adequate. I'm of the opinion that I get on an aeroplane to fly to a destination rather than for an extraordinary gastronomic experience and these flights did little to change that opinion. Inflight entertainment offering was good though my system did not work between London and Doha and the person sitting next to me on a later flight also suffered the same problem. In both instances the stewardesses seemed disinterested.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2214,2014-04-13,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Natalia Radcliffe,United Kingdom,2014-04-13,The outbound leg from LHR T4 to Doha was on a very old plane (still had cigarette disposal units). My partners' TV screen did not work. Although my screen did work the control panel was permanently embedded in the arm rest - not only did this make it highly awkward to use but the buttons were not programmed to correlate to the places displayed on screen. On the return leg from Doha to LHR the plane was just as bad - plus there were no bags containing earplugs and eye masks left for passengers! The PA system was not working well and kept deafening the passengers with feedback. To top this off there were only 2 loos available for what must have been around 200 economy passengers. I would never choose to fly Qatar again.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2215,2014-04-08,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Howsam,United Kingdom,2014-04-08,Economy - LHR to Melbourne. Boeing 777-200/300. Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock. Oryx entertainment system also excellent although the TV shows lacked variety. For my regular trips home to Aus I'm now to looking to Qatar first.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2216,2014-04-07,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Peter Lewis,United Kingdom,2014-04-07,Flew LHR-SIN via Doha. Flown many times on Qatar always in J class. B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection. Great fares and now Oneworld membership make it a no brainer for me and my family.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2217,2014-04-06,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,W Skyler,United States,2014-04-06,I flew with my family from Washington Dulles to Perth Australia. The aircraft was clean comfortable seats. When we got to Doha it was a 7 hour layover in a crowded airport and we were delayed by an hour because one passenger didn't show up however staff on the flight to Perth were helpful good food once again and good service and legroom on the plane. Will definitely use it again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2218,2014-04-03,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Hill Roger,United Kingdom,2014-04-03,Perth to London via Doha. Perth to Doha Boeing 777 had reasonable legroom. Service adequate meal selection poor. Doha - London Boeing 787 restricted legroom with impediment under seat in front. Again meals not great but good service. Both legs on time. Had to change flight 10 days before departing Perth at great cost.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2219,2014-04-02,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Kessler,Malaysia,2014-04-02,Geneva-Doha Doha KL on 29th/30th Jan 2014. Embarkation at Geneva was smooth and efficient. The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons). I don't understand why the seats are angled in the Airbus but not on the 777? I hope to fly again with Qatar but on their Boeing 777 rather than on their Airbuses.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2220,2014-04-02,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Henning Hansen,Denmark,2014-04-02,CRK-DOH-CPH on March 22-23. A330 and B787. Clean Planes and fine service onboard especially from Clark. And plenty off room at B787 from Doha to CPH even in the middle row. The Airport In Doha is not the best all the bus driving to and from the planes is annoying.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2221,2014-04-01,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Morris,United Kingdom,2014-04-01,LHR-DOH-COK. While the outbound flights were comfortable with clean planes and reasonable service our return flights were terrible. It all seems to depend on how busy business class. From the start checking in at Cochi airport took such a long time since the person at the desk seemed to have a difficult time checking in our bags through the London. As always the business lounge in Doha was packed. The main problem was on our morning flight from Doha to London. When breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. They were a choose of pancakes or waffles. Basically not much of a choice. When I asked if I could get more fruit or muesli I was told 'No'. The snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. Overall the in-flight service was terrible. Their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if I wanted a special meal I should have requested one. I would not recommend flying them in any class given their poor in-flight and customer service.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2222,2014-03-31,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Aweidah,Palestinian Territories,2014-03-31,AMM-DOH-AMM in economy both ways on 777 ER 300. Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day. European carriers business class is worse than QR economy.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2223,2014-03-30,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Lee,Singapore,2014-03-30,Paris CDG to Singapore (via Doha) Economy on QR 38 (A346) and QR 938 (B77L). Boarding was fast at CDG and flight left on time. Service on this flight was excellent - crew brought drinks regularly meals were served as soon as flight departed Paris and snack was give before landing at Doha and always a smile on the faces of the crew as they went around the cabin. There was leg space and seat width on the A346 but luckily for me the flight was not full and I had a whole row to myself. IFEs were older but nevertheless selection of movies were good. Extremely smooth landing at Doha before scheduled arrival time transfer to the terminal took about 10 minutes but once inside was able to connect to my next flight to Singapore with time to spare (I had a 1 hour 25 minute transit). QR 938 to Singapore on newer B77L flight was even emptier than the last so another row to myself as well. Seats wider on this aircraft with lots of legroom. Service was excellent once again towels and sweets passed around drinks came regularly breakfast served after takeoff and snack served before arrival in Singapore. Flight landed ahead of time. I would certainly recommend Qatar Airways and look forward to flying them again on my next trip - the airline is really going places especially with the new Hamad Airport set to open its doors within the next year or so.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2224,2014-03-30,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-03-30,NBO-DOH-SGN on 29 March. Airbus 320 (3x3 seat configuration) and 330 (2x4x2 seat configuration) respectively. Aircraft's neat and in good condition. Flights on time. Announcements were good. Staff attending and try their best though rarely suggest outside the box. Priority members highly respected recognized and acknowledged. FAs hardworking and attentive call buttons answered quickly. IFE good but not of my priority. Night-flights after midnight serve no dinner in economy very annoying for me. No beer options only a trivial Heineken is offered. What a pity as the world have so much better options to offer. Doha airport still a nightmare packed and imprisoned in busses without information or reasoning. A 2-days delayed bag from my previous trip was not compensated.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2225,2014-03-30,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Lee,Singapore,2014-03-30,Singapore to London (via Doha) Economy on 21-22 March 2013. QR 939 (77W) and QR 009 (A346). Boarding was a bit slow at Singapore Changi Airport but once on board seats were wider than most airlines and plenty of legroom! Staff were extremely professional towels and sweets handed out before take off meals promptly served upon departure cabin crew brought drinks regularly to customers etc. Touch screen IFE on the 77W was excellent though not as many choices as their Mid-East competitor Emirates. Smooth landing in Doha before midnight. Connected to QR 009 four hours later onto a A346 - service was once again excellent with regular drinks services and meals served promptly. The IFEs on the A346 were older but choices of movies the same as the 77W. Seats were once again comfortable but this time there was less legroom and seat width. Landed in London on time and bags on the belt within half an hour. Extremely pleased with the service and excellent value for money.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2226,2014-03-29,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Chris Hall,Australia,2014-03-29,Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights. This can only get worse until they get a second runway.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2227,2014-03-28,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R András,Hungary,2014-03-28,NRT-DOH-BUD Tokyo to Doha was on a 772LR. The service was excellent with choices ranging from Japanese dishes to westerner quite nice selection of wines as well. Inflight entertainment was good with plenty of movies to chose from. Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's. Overall I would recommend flying Qatar Airways I had a good experience.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2228,2014-03-28,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Wiegmann,Germany,2014-03-28,FRA-DOH-DXB-DOH-FRA. First 2 and last leg on 788 DXB to DOH leg on A320. Overall good experience 788 is a great plane clean toilets nice seats good IFE. Excellent wine selection which you often only find in First Class of other carriers. Food was poor no taste and little selection. That was better when I last took them. Staff were great on all flights and hopefully the transfer in DOH will one day be without busses. However: Staff in Frankfurt on check in as well as in DXB (both contracted) were unfriendly not interested in helping and the look and feel of the check in area was in both cases shabby.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2230,2014-03-26,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Kim Ly Khim,Canada,2014-03-26,Montreal Canada to Phnom Penh Cambodia. The service was more than I expected helpful crew. I had time to visit Doha at night during my transit. From Doha to Phnom Penh the flight was also agreeable but I was disappointed that no message was made for boarding. One hour before departure I started seeing people getting in line to embark. I waited until the last moment and mentioned to the Qatar staff that I didn't hear any announcement for boarding was that common practice? The staff member replied that they usually made an official announcement but this time they had not Besides that I really enjoyed flying Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2231,2014-03-24,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Young,France,2014-03-24,We flew from CDG via DOH to JNB and couldn't have been happier! Food and service excellent. Very clean toilets. We didn't use the inflight entertainment and therefore can't comment. Bus ride from plane to terminal seemed to take forever. Premium Terminal hopelessly overcrowded when we got there without a single table for 2 in sight. Fortunately we didn't have a long transfer time on our way back to CDG and could almost board immediately. We will definitely continue to take Qatar Airways for all of our long distance flights even if it means changing planes in Doha instead of going direct. Not only is Business Class so much more affordable than other European airlines but it is simply so much better as well! Keep up the great service!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Agree with review left by S Lloyd. Doha transit not good. Bus to terminal - poor facilities in airport (went to Oryx lounge in the hope of a shower but advised 1.5 hr wait for towels).

Recently flew Manchester-Doha- Singapore and was dissatisfied with the whole service. Flights outward and return were delayed. In Doha we were left in a holding area with approximately 100 other passengers with no ventilation air con or access to water in high temperatures with seats for only a dozen people whilst was waited for the nonsense of being bussed to our next flight. This happened on both the outward and return flights. Onboard staff were unfriendly and everything seemed too much trouble. Food was mediocre at best and repetitive. The entertainment system is outdated. I cannot recommend.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Overall a not-too-bad flight experience but QR staff really showed disorganization and even lack of interest. DXB-DOH flight was a breeze. Transfer at Doha airport is obviously the same chaos Silver Privilege Club Lounge is quite grotty. DOH-BCN: A332 equipment totally disorganized cabin crew. Food was fair just fair. IFE very poor and repetitive. Arrival on-time at BCN airport baggage were delivered very quickly with PC priority respected. At least a fair value for money.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

May be also my expectations were too high. Meals and wine cart are really very good. But the service is very slow. It's a real problem on the evening flight from Paris - it took almost 2 hours to have a dinner which is long as result - not much time to sleep. Seats are quit comfortable on A340 but not exceptional not comfortable at all on A321 (but it looks they will be replaced now). Transfer by buses in Doha is not an issue and Premium terminal is very big and provides a lot of place and different drinks and meals. What is strange: they don't serve champagne before take off in Paris but they do in Doha and in Male.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The seat on the B777 is great better for me than the new 787 one as I never travel alone and always wanted a window seat. Crew were excellent except on the short SIN-DPS.

The last flights I had was from JKT-DOH DOH-ANK IST-DOH DOH-JKT. All staff were polite friendly responsive and helpful. For economy class the seats have more space than EK or EY. The only complaint is transferring at Doha was not as convenient as transferring in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2238,2014-03-05,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,L Stiles,Australia,2014-03-05,Travelled with Qatar 6 times now first 4 or so were great and was left impressed. The last few flights have seen a decrease in service. Having said that seats are comfortable in-flight entertainment is pretty good food is ok but doesn't seem to change often (if at all) and flight attendants really do depend - have had really great ones and have had rude ones. I find the service a big part of the overall rating. Would fly again but not before looking around.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2239,2014-03-03,4,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Y Tomlinson,United Kingdom,2014-03-03,LHR to DOH en-route to Perth. This plane seemed very new it had a good touchscreen TV and a little tablet in the seat. Good movie options clear screen and sound. Seats were comfortable and roomy I also had 2 seats to myself which helped. Service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta in-between meals. Boarded a different plane from DOH to PER this was definitely an older plane. I was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane I've been on. Staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. The food wasn't that good. On the return I had an 11 hour PER to DOH and this only bearable because I luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. Again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. On the next 7 hour flight to LHR I was absolutely freezing! So much so I had to ask for a 2nd blanket.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Onboard seats great service lower than usual. Very sad to see the menus have still not changed in a year. It is sad to see levels in my favourite airline dropping. No value for money. I'm looking forward to see what my return flight has in store including a visit to the dreaded bidvest lounge in Cape Town which makes a wait in the terminal more pleasant than visiting the 'exclusive' lounge. Flagship premium terminal service and offering appalling. Will switch to another larger gulf carrier from now on despite frequent flyer status.,,Business Class,,,no,,

I'm very happy with this flight and nothing more to add  there was good foods friendly staff and a USB charger. Bangkok - Doha - Warsaw: Boeing 777 the plane was really old and my seat had a broken audio. We tested with 3 headphones and none worked so I had to sit for 7 hours watching the screen without any sound. One of the staff was rude we called her several of times and she ignored us and walked away.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Outward flight from Doha delayed (awaiting connecting passengers) which meant I missed my connection in Jo'burg. This was on South African but booked as through ticket with Qatar. No-one from Qatar to assist on arrival. SA would not rebook. Had to search airport for Qatar desk (which was in international departures miles away (and well hidden). This was highly stressful after 2 flights. Return trip flight one hour late into Doha. Efficient transit meant I caught the London flight but again one hour late. It seems that the transit for many passengers is leading increasingly to delays. Inflight service ok. 777 comfortable - 340 less so and poorer AVOD. Choice of films etc was excellent. Food tolerable but had the same chicken wrap 3 times and breakfast orange squash described as orange juice was disgusting. 3 flights out of 4 were an hour late. I would probably try to fly direct next time.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Crew excellent as usual on both of these sectors. Return sectors with a long layover at DOH (I left the airport to visit the city). CMB-DOH 17 Feb 2014 was on a B777 excellent leg room but IFE screen kept freezing and restarting of its own accord.

There is no where to store your glasses while you are sleeping. Drinks come only on request. Qatar Airways is not willing to transfer your baggage to another airlines. You have to pay extra or go through immigration to collect it and check in new. The infotainment is not that great. If the flight is cheap go for it.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The flight service food etc. were good but we expected more space between seats.

LHR-DOH was 1 hour late giving more time to enjoy great lounge but arrived DOH 15mins early and was the best J class flight I've ever had. Catering was superb but it seems you had to ask for afternoon tea service. DOH transfer was fine: yes the coach is slow but you're sitting comfortably and you get a view of the action of a busy airport. DOH-CMB also left late but there were no apologies or reasons from captain and no attempt to make up time en route.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2249,2014-02-14,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Mark McCullough,United Kingdom,2014-02-14,CMB-DOH-LHR 12 Feb. Excellent 777-3 first sector then less good less spacious not horizontal seat but acceptable A330-3. Both sectors left and arrived late without reasons or apologies from captain which is slack. Breakfast on 1st sector could have been better and more substantial as most pax would have had very early start to get flight and lounge at CMB didn't offer much. Boarding at CMB is hectic but J class pax were told to push their way to the front! Would be better if they called you from lounge after the melee had died down. Short transfer was fine at a quiet mid day DOH. LHR sector crew very nice but service procedures could be improved - they needed reminding to serve my partner and I together so we could eat at same time. Angled lie flat seat was OK for daylight flight. You had to ask for fast track immigration invitation. J class bags came last at LHR not QR's fault.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Having been a Privilege club member for 10 years I have seen the standards of service and quality of catering markedly decline. I flew Sofia-Doha last week. Having identified myself to cabin crew as a club member instead of being given an early choice of menu items I was told when they served dinner that my first choice was finished. However they somehow rustled up my first choice unfortunately it was inedible.

No airbridges means we had to shuttle in a bus for flight that was to take off right on time. Saw Dreamliner marking near tail and had mixed feelings of excitement and fear. 10 min into seating and pilot announced some technical snag. 10 more minutes and he announced that the wind shield had cracked and we that the plane can't take off. Surprisingly QR managed to arrange alternate plane of exact make sat us comfortably and took off in an hour. Food and IFE were perfect for 4 hrs long flight. I did not miss my connection from Bangalore. Wanted to shop for a few things in-flight but unfortunately they had run out of stock. We fly for safe and on time travel.

On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.,,Business Class,,,no,,

A recent fire meant there was no longer a lounge facility available but as premium passengers we were not offered anything in recompense. Even a voucher to enable us to get some food and drinks at the two upstairs cafes would have helped but on enquiry we were told that business class passengers were to get nothing just as the economy passengers. Thankfully the flight in an airbus A320 was comfortable and we were well looked after and the same could be said of the Doha - Manchester sector.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

2256,2014-02-04,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Wengler,Denmark,2014-02-04,BKK-DOH-BKK in Business Class January 2014. First leg was on the 777-300ER and was fine with very friendly and attentive staff. However staff had no idea about where we should go when we landed and I insisted that they were wrong about where they were sending us as we were having a one night layover. However staff insisted that we take the bus and get off at the Premium Lounge. This was of course wrong and we had to wait for a new bus to take us to immigration. Several movies were not showing on the plane but still it was ok. Personally I do prefer Emirates as they seem to have better entertainment onboard and better service. I only used Qatar cause they had joined Oneworld Alliance.,,Business Class,,,no,,

2258,2014-02-03,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Kuuskoski,Finland,2014-02-03,Flew OSL-DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH-ARN with Qatar. New 788s from Oslo and to Stockholm. DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH A320s. Very friendly and attentive service from dominantly Eastern European and Subcontinental crews. 1-2-1 configuration in 788 business class very nice indeed and A320 business class quite comfortable too (even though not good for sleeping). Some inconsistencies in service on some flights my oneworld Emerald status was acknowledged on some not. A very annoying aspect of Qatar service is that the oneworld Emerald status does not give you access to First class facilities and you don’t get First class labelling to your luggage. This is different from other oneworld carriers with First class (at least British Airways Cathay Pacific and Qantas) and puts Qatar in an inferior position. The IFE was quite impressive (also on A320s) but did not match the latest IFE on Cathay 77Ws. Qatar provides top notch quality but I would say that Cathay is par at food and beverages but still slightly better in service and much better in attention to details. Cathay’s First class lounges are very nice too its difficult to provide a comparison as I was not admitted to the Qatari facility. In summary I probably will consider Qatar to destinations in East and West Africa and the Middle East but necessarily to South East Asia as changing planes in Doha late in the evening is a nuisance when compared to flying the long Europe – Asia leg non-stop after having enjoyed BA/CX First class hospitality while waiting for the flight.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2259,2014-01-28,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Beeby,United Kingdom,2014-01-28,MAN-DOH-SIN return. All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights. However all of the above comments pale into insignificance compared to the loathsome experience of Doha airport; it is truly awful. And no one from QR can say when this sorry airport state will end.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

First time on a 787 Dreamliner (Manchester to Doha) great plane very quiet and plenty of seat room. Felt very relaxed. A much better plane than the old Airbus which I hope has now been replaced on this sector.

2262,2014-01-28,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Johnson,United Kingdom,2014-01-28,I booked a week before travelling to Dhaka via Doha and due to equipment needed for my project the cheapest way to travel was 1st class.In addition this was where Qatar Airways stands out is the short time between flights this was 3 hours whereas BA and Turkish was a lot longer. My experiences at Heathrow T4 were very pleasant check in was easy and the lounge was not far after security. The lounge itself was very pleasant and the level of service excellent. The range of refreshments and services cannot be praised highly enough. The airline had a cart at the lounge to drive passengers to the gate - a very nice touch. The inflight experience was great. I decided to miss dinner and it was great to just lay on a comfortable flat bed and catch a good few hours sleep. I flicked through the inflight entertainment and was not too impressed by the range of media although if I was not as frequent a traveller then the entertainment on offer would have been fine. On arriving at Doha nice to be taken to the transit area in a BMW. I was only in Doha for 3 hours but again the lounge was very pleasant and relaxing. The flight to Dhaka was in Business Class but very good all the same. The only poor aspect was the wait for baggage in Dhaka but then that's not really Qatar's fault. I would certainly fly with Qatar in future.,,First Class,,,N/A,,

Engines not as quiet as I had hoped but chicken curry was delicious such a shame I had to eat it with plastic cutlery! Choice of entertainment on board for a western male was also disappointing far less than on equivalent Emirates flight. The flight was on-time and the cabin crew were polite and helpful. However the flight lands in Doha possibly the worlds biggest shambles of an airport.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2264,2014-01-23,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2014-01-23,SGN-DOH-NBO. Solid product. A-330. New aircraft. Flights on time. Food standards tend to slip a bit further and likewise the wines that are now cheaper and for instance not served in mini-bottles anymore. Entertainment fine. Staff good and focused on work. Doha airport still a nightmare and one waste 1-2 hours of being shipped in busses far far from terminals. DOH-NBO on Airbus 320. Aircraft new clean seat of OK space. Flight full but service and FAs created a good atmosphere much more than OK. Would have preferred proper lunch instead of breakfast on a flight from 9am-2pm. Food and wine standards have dropped a bit but still at 4-star level. IFE very good. A suitcase went missing at arrival in NBO but not only to blame QR as other airlines were involved before Saigon and obviously could only manage to get the luggage to DOH. It was brought 1 day later in elegant wrapping and upon proper notification.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

This business class service and cabin are almost a first class service. Once in Doha the staff were very helpful. Because our flight was changed we were invited to the First Class lounge. They provided us a room and were allowed to use all the First Class lounge facilities during our transit to Bali. The only thing that has to be pointed out is the Singapore 1.30 stop.

Was trapped inside the bus for sometime very stuffy. The Oneworld flagship aircraft is very generous with sit pitch sufficient amenity kit headphone waiting in the seat pocket. Excellent in flight entertainment and sound system flawless catering and the snack was awesome.

Dreamliner is brilliant. 777 on the DOH-PER leg not quite as comfortable - the seats are not actually 100% flat. The leg section sags which makes it hard to sleep completely comfortably. Service food and IFE impeccable. WiFi now allowed on the LHR-DOH Dreamliner and this is NOT a good idea. The person behind me was constantly receiving messages and didn't bother to turn his ringtone down. The usual bugbear of a ""scenic drive"" round Doha airport on the outward leg meant only 10 minutes in the (excellent) Premium Terminal. On the return leg both stands were near the Terminal but terminal time was reduced by being sent to the gate 40 minutes before boarding started.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2272,2014-01-20,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Charles Lacoste,Australia,2014-01-20,Flew QR 901 PER-DOH QR 721 DOH-ORD and on the way back QR 010 LHR-DOH and QR900 DOH-PER earlier this month. Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the US…and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHR…IFE was great… wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age. Inside the terminal is very ordinary. New terminal on the way promises to be much better. Would fly them again for sure.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

All seats in business class have direct access to the aisles. Service and food as good as always. Looking forward to my next trip with QR hopefully the new airport in DOH will be ready then as the long bus rides at old airport are somehow annoying.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

As we are now living in Doha for work purposes 3 of those 4 flights originated in Doha. Doha to JFK to Florida and back to Doha. Our first two flights 12 months ago in economy class were very nice. Much better than the other airlines we have travelled on for international flights. However in the past 12 months the other two flights have shown a huge decrease in quality of service and a huge increase in cost. The main difference that seems glaring is the level of attentiveness from the Flight Attendants the quality of food that is now being served and the huge cost increase.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

After an 8hr 21 min delay due to fog we discovered the aircraft was switched from the Dreamliner (787) to the A330. The switch in aircraft certainly extended the delay. The communication to update on the flight was terrible. Once we reached Doha we were told there was no other way back to NYC other than taking the flight on 7th Jan (QR 701). The transit process on 7th January felt was awful there was lack of communication. Once we reached the aircraft we waited and waited until the captain announced we would be delayed - ended up being 1hr 10 mins. While in the air the aircraft was new and we were lucky enough to have an emergency seat. The flight crew appeared tired and unwilling to be pleasant to passengers. Most of the food was barely edible. We landed and 1 hr and 32mins late with no apology or update from the pilot on our flight progress.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Check-in at BCN was quite chaotic same for boarding. Food was low quality with small portions seat pitch was small as usual and entertainment very reduced. Big black point from cabin crew: I asked for a tooth brush after meal response: no. Transfer at Doha was chaotic: I was very close to missing my flight due to a staff member at the security point. I had to make a ruckus at the line until he accepted to let me go. Always the same plastic - flavoured snack served on second leg DOH-DXB.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2279,2014-01-13,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Srinivasan,United States,2014-01-13,"IAH-DOH-MAA in Y. Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg. Service by the FAs was consistently excellent with every request attended to promptly and with a smile. Qatar offers a very good coach product overall and is a superior alternative to Emirates if you are headed to Asia or the Middle East.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2280,2014-01-13,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Tercon Bojan,Singapore,2014-01-13,Flying in Business Class from Bali - Singapore - Doha on the new 777-300ER is a remarkable experience. Qatar is definitely up there amongst the best in terms of inflight product on the 777-300ER. The seat converts into a fully-flat bed and although the layout is very open (compared to SQ and EK) given the 2-2-2 layout walking over your neighbour in order to reach the aisle is not overly cumbersome. The food and service was excellent although am not a huge fan of some of their colour choices for their uniforms. I also really liked the PJs that you get although then you realize that the bathrooms are very small and changing is not that easy. SQ for example has a much bigger lavatory up front and also more stylish. Qatar could improve on this. What I'm not a big fan of is their IFE system. It seems very simplistic trying to move the mouse around the basic user interface and the choice of movies is lacking. This was perhaps the biggest drawback on my Qatar flight.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

The food was the best I've had in Business and a great anytime style menu. Seat was comfortable to sit in and the full lie flat beds were great. My wife and I both got a solid 8 hours sleep which is testament to the quality of the seat/bed. We were also provided with amenities pack and pyjamas which we made use of. Aircraft was modern and well looked after and flight smooth. I'd say its as good as if not better than Emirates business and considerably cheaper.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2283,2014-01-13,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,H Peter,Australia,2014-01-13,Berlin - Doha - Melbourne in Economy. A330 Berlin - Doha. Seat comfort was very good and space no issue and I'm 6'3. Food was also very good for an economy flight. A choice of 3 meals. Flight attendants were polite and friendly but because they have so many people to look after can come across a bit rushed. Doha - Melbourne 777-200LR . Seats didn't feel quite as comfortable but it didn't help that the person in front was reclined the whole way but alas so did I. Still managed to have a sleep. Flight attendants were polite and friendly. Food served while ok wasn't as good as the previous flight. Total flying time was around 17.5 hours from Berlin which was the quickest we have ever done it in and good if you have kids. One thing to mention we did have quite a few families near us and the staff really looked after them which was good to see. gave them some toys cool lunch boxes with meals in them and a little play time etc. Plane to terminal is by bus in Doha but with their new airport which is almost finished being built I think it'll be a thing of the past.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

The car that was to transfer me to the plane came only after all business class passengers left to buses while I had to wait at the gate door. Onboard the A330 was new and clean seats comfortable staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was outstanding the best first class food I ever had. The greatest drawback was the IFE.

What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided. The transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. All over a decent experience.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Although staff called for boarding by seat numbers nobody took any notice. Both flights full service on board was poor to say the least. Inflight food although served hot was not appetising drink rounds for water and juices had to go to galley and ask for them only brought through cabin once on each sector.

2289,2014-01-03,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Steinfeld,Indonesia,2014-01-03,Economy SIN-ZRH-SIN via Doha. Flight operations were fine helped by the mostly very friendly and responsive staff and the use of state-of-the-art equipment (777/787). The choice and quality of the food was however nothing to rave about. Whatever its length any layover at Doha is painful to say the least. This is partially due to the poor infrastructure of the airport but also due to the rather chaotic organization of the airline's ground operations. On the way back I had a 8+ hour layover. I did not want to spend this time at the airport and booked a hotel. When enquiring at Zurich airport if I could leave the airport at Doha I was informed that this may be difficult. We still got off at the Arrival Terminal and - while the waiting period (about 1 hour) and the visa-on- arrival charge was a kick in the teeth immigration was smooth but getting away from the airport was again somewhat frustrating. The airline has potential but has to improve its ground services. In any case I will not take another flight with Qatar Airways until the new Doha airport is operational.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

I was not impressed with the Dreamliner (787) that QR used for the flight from London to Doha and vice versa. The IFE did not work so we didn't have anything to watch or listen to. Some of the toilets were already in a mess. FAs were friendly and helpful. I should give them credit for trying to make the journey enjoyable. Flight from Doha to Kilimanjaro and the return flight were OK. The food was also average. Would I recommend QR? I would if you get the right price and if there is no choice.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

During all of my flights the inflight entertainment system did not work properly for my seat and when it finally worked the screen was so scratched that it was hard to see anything. The seats were comfortable because the flight was almost empty yet the food could be classed only as average. When wanting to change the date of my return flight I was not helped at all on the phone nor through email/ website and when I actually went physically to their office in HK I was refused a change despite me wanting to pay for the difference. I cannot recommend them due to the service issues.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

I like the eat on demand service as we can time the meals. Great choice and great amenities. On route back we had a 8.5 hour lay over and had booked a room. But the thought of negotiating immigration was not very appealing and whiled away the time in the Premium lounge. Had sleeper couches and even fresh blankets and a great shower with L'Occitane toiletries. Spoilt for choice when it came to food.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2293,2013-12-29,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2013-12-29,NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2294,2013-12-29,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P J Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,2013-12-29,DXB-DOH-BCN Dec 19th. Privilege Club golden membership is really appreciable: 15 kg extra luggage complimentary access to First Class lounge in Dubai and Barcelona and Oryx Lounge in Doha and (at least when it is respected) priority boarding. However the flight itself was not really enjoyable: chaotic take-off proceed at Dubai Doha transfer long and disorganised (as usual in that grotty old airport) and night flight to Barcelona in an uncomfortable Airbus A330-200. QR cabin crew did their best to make the journey pleasant with good PAX interaction). Gold and Silver Privilege Club members were treated personally as cabin crew called us by our name and gave us priority for breakfast preference (3 choices available between regular sweet and vegetarian). Flight arrived at El Prat on time and police and customs procedures were smooth. A good airline anyhow.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2296,2013-12-25,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,V Loras,United Kingdom,2013-12-25,London to Doha in business on the new Airbus. Our flight attendants English wasn't very good and they were not as efficient as other airlines. My dinner was overcooked and too salty. Staff were very kind and gave me a different meal. I had issues with my TV. It kept cutting out the entire flight. The beds are rights next to one and other. I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane. Worst inflight TV selection I've seen on a plane. Old movies and only a few new western release movies. Arrived into Doha for a 6 hour stop over and the Business Lounge is already looking very tired. Qatar would not be my first choice next time I fly. Up side: Amazing pyjamas and toiletry bag.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2297,2013-12-23,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,J Clifford,Australia,2013-12-23,Have just completed 2 very much anticipated legs with Qatar Airways Paris to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. We were so disappointed which is hardly what I expected to be saying here Used Air France La Premiere lounge in Paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. Boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. Only served with rice. It did do the trick though as required no dessert. Cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. Our arrival in Doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the Premium Lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight. Pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew. All in all not quite what we expected and if this particular flight is anything to go on will not fly with them again.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2298,2013-12-21,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,E Irgens,Norway,2013-12-21,"Doha - Oslo. Attentive but unobtrusive crew. The 787 business class seat is outstanding and the entertainment screen is huge and sharp. Such a shame they fail horribly with the remote control/user interface. It is very slow and unresponsive. Whenever I tried to pause a film it would instead jump to the middle and I'd spend a lot of time fiddling and trying to get back to where I was. Several TV-shows (new) were of such low technical quality they might have been VHS recordings. The never-ending commercials that take over the entertainment system at the end of each flight are quite annoying. And please come up with a ""do not disturb"" solution. I don't like being woken up for a meal if I'm finally asleep.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2299,2013-12-21,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,P Stephenson,Australia,2013-12-21,Sitting in the lounge at Doha waiting for the leg of my trip from Perth to London. Wanted to quickly comment on the first leg. Flight very full (probably sold out) but service slow even despite this. Normally trays removed immediately but left sitting in front of us for nearly an hour. No extra drinks offered. Request for blanket never materialised. Vegetarian Hindu meal very average. Entertainment very good. Note for those looking for an upgrade: had a phone call on the day of flight asking me to go first class on following day's flight. Unfortunately couldn't do it but worth knowing it can be offered.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2300,2013-12-17,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Pavan Leonardo,Italy,2013-12-17,VCE-DOH-MEL. The VCE-DOH leg was on a A320: comfy seats however not the full flat bed which is fine considering that it is only a 5.5hrs flight. The DOH-MEL was very comfortable full flat bed very nice amenities from the pyjama to the slippers to the toiletries; very much appreciated the larger bathroom very good AVOD. Service has been gracious and attentive all the way through food served was tasty and freshly prepared. The business lounge in DOH welcoming and with a good food variety a lot of space for everyone and good facilities. Pity that you have to take the shuttle from the aircraft to the airport and return but I'm sure it will be resolved with the new terminal. I must add that I was a bit taken aback by the behaviour of the staff upon arrival in MEL: some paramedics and public health officers boarded the plane as soon as the gangway was connected and the flight attendants seemed to be very unprepared to handle the traffic flow of passengers off the aircraft and the boarding officers: very bizarre!,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2301,2013-12-16,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Anders Pedersen,Denmark,2013-12-16,NBO-DOH-MXP and return. Flights on time and check in smoothly. Outbound: No lounge access given in NBO despite lounges are becoming restored upon the fire in August. NBO-DOH: Small aircraft A320. Onboard: Food plenty 2 options given for dinner. Drinks also plenty. Wines are the same 4 which has been offered for the recent 3 years. No options to select beer apart from Heineken. Juices few and no innovations for years. IFE on A320 (NBO-DOH) ridiculous (overhead monitors showing soap). Premium frequent flyers identified and respected by crew given some preferential options (food luggage seating). The A330-200 flights (DOH-MXP-DOH) were also pretty full. IFE good. Service OK to good. Note for QR flights departing after midnight that only breakfasts are offered in economy (three choices though). Champagne served MXP-DOH. MXP lounge used by QR was excellent with a super view to the runways (separate review). DOH-NBO: Upgraded to business class as economy was full/almost full. Excellent service. Dinner served 01:30 - 4 options for hot main dish. Two class-champagnes offered and high-class wines as well. 10 of 12 seats in business were taken (of which 2-3 were assumed upgrades). No lie flat but OK for 5 hours flight.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Overall the plane quality and cleanliness are good or above average but in regards to the facilities the USB port on the seats on all airlines seems not to work properly. It doesn't charge properly. It may seems small matters but arriving in a destination without working phone is troublesome and unable to contact anyone in emergency. Service on the BUC-DOH was rude and ignorant. Request for flight attendant was turned off without questioning on the issue.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

2306,2013-12-11,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,G Buchanan,United Kingdom,2013-12-11,Flight from Manchester to Bali (8/11/13) was a pleasant experience with fantastic crew on both legs. We even got a honeymoon cake on the first leg. Not a problem with the airline at all just some rude travellers flying with us. MAN-DOH Airbus A330-200 a bit tired but by no means old DOH-DPS Boeing 777-200ER modern aircraft and comfortable. The return journey however was a shambles (20/11/13). Denpasar to Doha with a stop in Singapore. DOH-MAN was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head Flight Attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears. Older aircraft and a fair few AVOD systems not working including my own for the first 30 minutes of the flight. All they could do was reset it.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2307,2013-12-09,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Karen Clark,Australia,2013-12-09,DPS-ORD-DPS. Our flight was delayed 4 hours out of Denpasar due to APEC being held in Bali and the airport being closed to the public at certain hours of the day. We knew this in advance and asked to change our flight a day earlier as we only had a 3 hour lay over in Doha before our flight to Chicago. Qatar assured us that the airport closure would not affect them and that changing our flight would incur a fee. We were met at Doha airport by ground staff who gave us the option of staying overnight or flying to Chicago without our luggage. As we had only two nights in Chicago we decided to fly without our luggage. The luggage arrived at our hotel the next day. In the air we always find the product and the service given very good and of a uniform quality. Our return flight left on time from Chicago with a 5 hour wait for our flight to Bali. This turned into a 12 wait as our flight was delayed. The captain made an announcement explaining the delay and apologized for any inconvenience This is the second time I have experienced problems with connections being late and whilst I understand these things happen I hope it does not become the norm. It feels like this airline is growing very fast and needs the new airport and new aircraft to keep up with demand. Their business class product is very good and we were not disappointed once we were in the air.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2308,2013-12-05,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Aziz,United Kingdom,2013-12-05,Travelled on LHE-DOH-MAN flight in economy class. LHE-DOH was with 777-ER and had comfortable seats but DOH-MAN was A330 an old model with really congested seats. Not only this but inflight crew were not helpful. Food quality is just enough but most of all I found Doha airport really dis-satisfactory. The transit terminal and arrivals are served with buses and that makes transit very painful especially if travelling with kids. I am not impressed with Qatar Airways.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2309,2013-12-02,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Nadkarni Rahul,India,2013-12-02,Flew Business class on Goa-Doha-New York (JFK) on 13 Nov and return on 27 Nov New York (JFK) - Doha-Goa. The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities. All in all a very satisfying experience and we would surely fly Qatar airways again.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2310,2013-11-29,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,David Stahl,Sweden,2013-11-29,"Stockholm-Doha-Kochi (India) on Nov 26. I have done this trio many times with QR and I'm very satisfied. The new Dreamliner from Stockholm to Doha is very comfortable spacious and silent. But I couldn't see that the windows were bigger! A spacious galley with fruits cakes and an unopened champagne bottle. Plenty of space for legs hand baggage and computer reading materials and other small things at the seat. The toilet are very spacious. On the Doha-Kochi sector they have put in bigger aircraft's with ""angled lie flat chairs"" in Business class. A big improvement to the old planes on this sector. Very friendly staff competent they managed to make my computer hook on to the WiFi system onboard. In QR business class you can get food served whenever you want. On an earlier flight on the same sector they wanted to serve a third dinner on the flight Doha-Kochi (the two earlier were on Stockholm-Doha and in Doha terminal) but I asked for breakfast instead and they gave me a really good breakfast! The staff was apologetic that they couldn't give me an omelette but I tried to convince them that it didn't matter. I call that service. I feel the staff onboard is QR's best resource airport staff are very good too.",,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2311,2013-11-28,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Barton,United Kingdom,2013-11-28,MAN-DOH-BKK-HAN-SGN-DOH-MAN. Really impressed with the seats service and entertainment on all flights. World class airline in same bracket as Emirates and Etihad. Arguably Singapore Airlines still marginally superior. 777 seats wider and entertainment system better than A330 however 2-4-2 layout is preferable for couples relative to the 3-3-3 777 layout. Fortunate to be upgraded to business on the red eye SGN - DOH flight which was great notwithstanding that particular A330 being an older example. Still extremely comfortable and accommodated an excellent night's sleep. Check in for all sectors fine Doha airport bus transfers a bit of a novelty but acceptable and soon to be replaced. Will certainly use the airline again if priced most competitively as was the case in this instance.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2312,2013-11-22,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Farouk Mogheth,Thailand,2013-11-22,Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Check in at Houston: the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. They do as anyone can find out on the Qatar Airways website. Continuing with the flight attendants. They all seemed to be in-training: could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. On both ways my choice of food was not available. I had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. The 777LR aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. Doha Airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of Qatar. Taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. Overall not a bad airline.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Food was fine the guy at the check in counter changed my seat three times as people checked in to get me an empty bulkhead row so good on him. Onboard the service was awful. My flight attendant had a scowl rushed passed me at every opportunity and was really surly with requests.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2315,2013-11-18,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Walmsley,Australia,2013-11-18,PER-DOH-LHR and return. Having never flown with Qatar (normally a Singapore customer) I was tempted by the price and time saved by flying through the Middle East. Can't really fault the experience too much and would recommend them. The PER-DOH flight was a 777 and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and space - felt very relaxed. Entertainment was good too with plenty of films etc. The new Dreamliner flight from DOH-LHR was nearly as good but definitely more cramped. Knees pressing against seat in front. Those IFE boxes have a lot to answer for especially on aisle seats - feet space is minimal. Luckily for me on all 4 flights I had no one sitting next to me so could stretch out. May have been lower score if flight was full. Food and service on all flights was as good as it gets although return trip to Perth was a bit lacking as they were tight with offering up water. Doha airport is in the middle of an upgrade so it was a bit chaotic but ok. Definitely would fly with them again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2316,2013-11-15,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Ian Lancaster,United Kingdom,2013-11-15,TRV-DOH-LHR Nov 12 Business. My first Qatar flight taking advantage of the airline joining OneWorld. And in one word - excellent. A320 (or was it 321?) out of Trivandrum to Doha big comfortable seat - a proper business/1st class seat not a pretend one like most airlines use on their single-aisle short-haul aircraft. A 50-minute transfer in Doha which went very smoothly (would I have made it if I'd had baggage or been in economy?) and a lie-flat seat on a 777 to LHR. Very attentive FAs decent food excellent AVOD on time (actually half-hour early in to LHR thanks to wind).,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Jacquart Champagne and Janneau Cognac were served during the flight cabin crew was very attentive. However food options limited and quite low-quality. IFE poor this time with a very small choice of new movies and music albums. Seats were quite comfortable. All-day snack is very repetitive for frequent flyer always the same pizza and almond cake! Transfer at Doha was ok but I hate that old airport. It's a good new to know that they will shift soon to new terminal.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2319,2013-11-04,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Mohamud Farah Rage,Denmark,2013-11-04,CPH-DOH-NBO. NBO-DOH-CPH. Been doing this leg every summer since 2011 loved the trip. Chatted with the Cabin Crew. The service was excellent hard working staff in DOH. Nairobi Staff were too serious could smile a little more. Food was ok but I would like some changes as the meals have been the same over the last 2 years. IFE was excellent but the seat space was a little too tight. Excited to Fly with QR again this December and can't wait to Experience the 787 from CPH!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2320,2013-11-01,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Chatzi,Greece,2013-11-01,ATH-DOH-DXB on 320 and 787 respectively. All flights on time with smooth transfers in DOH. That said new airport must open ASAP as it will make the experience much more pleasant. Staff attentive and friendly but would have liked to see a few more smiles especially during service time. Food and beverages good well presented. Cabin atmosphere nice and relaxing but the seat comfort on the dreamliner not so good. Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options. DOH-DXB we were not offered headphones because 'it is a very short flight' as we were advised. Their 4-star competition does offer headsets on this route though. All in all a nice experience would definitely recommend but a little overestimated airline.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2321,2013-10-30,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Johnston,United Kingdom,2013-10-30,MAN-DOH-BKK. Check in at Manchester was fine due to my height 6ft’6 I'd asked for a note to be posted on the system asking for a seat with extra legroom. Priority boarding for Privilege Club members took off a few minutes late flight seemed to be full. The cabin crew soon were coming around with drinks and menus entertainment system ready for use I checked what was on offer and was watching my first choice movie when the meal was served. I had a chicken noodle dish which was one the best meals I'd had in economy class. I rarely sleep on a flight but I may have dozed off for a few minutes before watching a few more movies. Arrived at Doha earlier than expected I had 1 hour 20 minutes transit so had booked the Al Maha Fast track service a very efficient young lady met me at the plane and travelled with me on the transfer bus escorted me direct to the onward check-in for the next flight and straight passed the queue to the departure bus. Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight. Business cabin had only 10 passengers so we were all spoilt by the best cabin crew I've experienced members of the crew introduced themselves and chatted to passengers.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

What bothered us was: Half of the plane was very hot and the other half was freezing (same thing happened last year). That each of us including a 2-year old baby were assigned seats in an entirely different location. The entertainment systems often had some minor faults (kept fast forwarding movies if one put their arm on the armrest some buttons did not work at all). Will try a different route next time if possible.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2323,2013-10-29,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,H Yu,Japan,2013-10-29,JNB-DOH-ALG Sept. This is my second time with Qatar. The hand-lotion had disappeared 30 minutes after departure and was not been replaced. The airport is so crowed (might not be the fault of the airline) maybe not for business flyers (hopefully it can join One-World quicker so that when I use the airport next time I can use their lounge). The super cheap ticket is good that it is accessible for many people but the coin definitely has another side!,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2324,2013-10-29,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Sutton,United Kingdom,2013-10-29,We flew recently from London to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia via Doha. The entire trip (to and from) consisted of four 7-hour flights with approximately 2-4 hours stopover at Doha Airport. While we do not have any major complaints Qatar Airways in our opinion do not deserve a 5* airline rating for economy class. The cleanliness of the plane left a lot to be desired. On all four legs of the journey scraps of litter could be seen near the window seats. Food remnants were found on the fold-down table and on the cushion supplied. We were generally satisfied in terms of the level of service food entertainment and the comfort of seat. The touch screen can be a bit hit-and-miss and on one of our flights my partner's TV screen was faulty. Staff were all very polite although it would be interesting to see how they cope if the plane was busier. Previous experience with Emirates were far more satisfactory.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Purser came around to make personal introduction and to explain flight amenities. Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch (including a 2003 Brunello di Montalcino). All flights were on time or early. The only strange part of the whole experience is the long bus ride from the plane to the terminals - I did it twice as I was transiting through DOH. The Business Class Lounge is probably one of the most grand and well-served that I have experienced. There are multiple stations for tea/coffee snacks full meals and a fully stocked bar. They also provide table service. Flight departures are announced discreetly but effectively.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2327,2013-10-15,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Richard Batah,Canada,2013-10-15,YUL-DOH-DAC. Sep 27 2013. Our flights were on time. We were very well received on board. The service was great. The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. The Premium Lounge in Doha is very comfortable meeting all our needs and transit time was short. We've been flying this route for 3 years now and have not had any delays. We flew a B777-200 to Doha and A330-200 to Dhaka. Just love the young fleet. The only negative is that the lie flat beds on theA330 which do not completely lie flat are not as comfortable as on the B777. Can't wait to fly Qatar again.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Have just returned to Melbourne from Paris having done the same sectors last year. Another faultless (as far as they can be) flying experience. Good food wine and service. Although a nice terminal at Doha the transfer is a bit lengthy. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Qatar again. Entertainment selection not huge but OK.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,
2329,2013-10-15,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,D Shah,United Kingdom,2013-10-15,LHR-DOH-NBO. Flew the Dreamliner 787 from LHR-DOH fantastic aircraft great in-flight entertainment the steward(ess's) were all friendly and smiling food was really tasty seats were comfortable too. Transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha was quite lengthy but guess that will improve once they have the new terminal. From DOH-NBO it was an A320 small aircraft but comfortable and again good food and service throughout. The only complaint I have about the flight was that my flight was from 16.00 GMT+1 arriving in NBO 05.35 (GMT+1) and on the LHR-DOH leg they said they don't provide amenity kits because its a day flight (I only wanted the sleeping shades) and then when I got onto the DOH-NBO flight again they don't provide the amenity kits (the flight was from 02.20 - 07.35 GMT+3). Then they serve Dinner on this 2am flight without a doubt the foods great but its 2am and I wanted to sleep. So if your flying on some overnight flight then take your own in economy!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2330,2013-10-13,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Tim Crowley,United Kingdom,2013-10-13,LHR-DOH and DOH-SIN economy. Great flight in economy from LHR-DOH. Seats comfortable service excellent and inflight entertainment good. Overnight flight and managed to get sleep. Only criticism is they turned lights on a bit early before landing in DOH. Had a quick transfer in DOH for flight to SIN but waited on ground for other connections so flight departed 80 mins late. Plane from DOH to SIN a 777 which was bigger than 330. Again seats good but service very poor with 2 cabin attendants who must have come from BA they were so surly. Inflight entertainment system slower than the flight from LHR. On plus side the 2 flights were the smoothest and quietest I have ever had from UK to SIN. Airline a good 4 star but not 5.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2331,2013-10-13,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Michael Schrier,Philippines,2013-10-13,My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.,,Business Class,,,no,,
2332,2013-10-10,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Kent,United Kingdom,2013-10-10,Aspires to be a 'five' star airline. We flew UK to Malaysia via Doha two 7hr legs with a 3hr stop over in Doha. Planes were pretty clean seats fairly comfortable but we had a much newer plane on the 2nd outbound leg and this was the best leg of our return trips. Staff were very nice drinks plentiful and varied food pretty good too. Entertainment system worked fine good selection of films/TV to keep you busy. MAS we have flown before are a 5* airline the planes and service just that bit better though you do pay more. Baggage allowance was increased just before we flew to 30kg. They are also fairly relaxed on hand luggage which does mean the overhead storage fills up! The transfer in Doha involved a lengthy bus shuttle to/from the terminal building but perhaps we were unlucky where our planes were parked. I'd use again but would weigh up the saving over a direct flight as there's not much in Doha!,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2333,2013-10-10,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R John,Australia,2013-10-10,MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2334,2013-10-09,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Khan,United Kingdom,2013-10-09,Flew from Heathrow to Kathmandu. Everything was good until Doha however a bit sad from Doha to Kathmandu. It was bit tight but overall experience was excellent.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2335,2013-10-02,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Uttiya,United States,2013-10-02,IAH-DOH-CCU-DOH-IAD September 23 2013. IAH-DOH - Incoming aircraft had a lightening strike on its way in and needed a complete check by engineers in Houston. This delayed the flight by over 5 hours and everyone missed connections in DOH. Qatar staff in Doha came through for everyone with alternate flights already worked out by the time we reached DOH. Most people were provided transit visas and accommodation with a generous food allowance in DOH. IFE was good food was okay. Cabin staff was polite and helpful. DOH-CCU - Cabin crew excellent. I had a non functional IFE screen and they tried a restart thrice. After that they switched my seat. The food service was thorough service was attentive and I felt comfortable in a flight with service after a long time. CCU-DOH - Good cabin crew good food and attentive service. Ground staff from Air India could not keep up with the Qatar staff and fumbled the service all through. On the flight smooth sailing. DOH-IAH - Attentive cabin crew and good service all round. The only negative was when they ran out of meal options for the lunch service and had to force the same veg option on everyone. IFE malfunctioned during the flight and they reset the whole system that took 30 mins or so. However IFE service was good. Overall satisfied with the service crew and IFE. It would be better for them to rethink their Indian choice for veg as the food tends to get too dry over a long haul flight.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2336,2013-10-01,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Norman Lee,Singapore,2013-10-01,SIN-DOH-MAN/BRU-DOH-SIN. Excellent on-board service and the seat pitch is the best I have seen in Economy for a long time. The 777s use 3-3-3 configuration which makes for a comfortable seat. Pouches with toothbrush socks ear plugs and eye-mask were given out on the overnight sectors. Only thing that could get better was on the BRU- DOH sector crew ran out of food trays at the back of the plane and had to ask a few times from the crew in the front. I also had to remind the crew that my travelling companion needed a diabetic meal. But these are small issues. In all value for money better than the other airlines who try to pack close to 400 passengers on their 777s for the same price.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2337,2013-09-29,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Brennan,Australia,2013-09-29,"PER-DOH-JFK PER-DOH-CDG MXP-DOH-PER. Great new fleet even the older A320s and A330s are new compared to other major airlines. Newer 777s are gorgeous though have flaws (like stuck TV screens and dirty seats). Food is average. When connecting for hours in Doha you still find yourself with a breakfast omelette followed by another breakfast omelette on the next flight? Entertainment system - good when it works. Great selection but on 6 flights I had 3 seats without working TV and 4 headphones that did not work. Service - pretty poor. Staff are generally indifferent friendly-but-dazed. Timeliness - my experience has not tracked with the on-time stats of the airline. I had one out of six flights depart on time. The rest arrived late by an hour or so. Very decent option for the price but not anywhere as good an experience as its ""5 Star"" competitors such as Singapore or Cathay.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2338,2013-09-25,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,James Laskowski,Thailand,2013-09-25,"BKK-CDG w/a change in Doha and CDG-BKK. This is the 2nd time I have flown w/ Qatar this year and each leg the service is friendly and efficient and the Food is really good. Not to mention their on-time departures. The seats have sufficient space even reclines (well for me at least at 5'7""). They have great selection of food and entertainment and if your lucky enough for an overnight flight a great pouch consisting of socks eye-mask and toothbrush. Anytime you ask for help or are served the flight attendants have a smile. For the money - this is by far my favorite airline.",,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2339,2013-09-25,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,S Chim,Singapore,2013-09-25,SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2340,2013-09-24,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,W Harsha,United Kingdom,2013-09-24,LHR-DXB return via DOH. First leg on A330 - seat and entertainment fine. I hold privilege club gold status and was greeted onboard by crew. Meal choices outlined were inconsistent with what was actually served. Overnight flight which departed one hour late - cabin lights dimmed after dinner service but fully illuminated three hours before landing when they served a snack (which was appalling). Missed connecting flight in Doha but was already booked onto the next flight and had to wait only 90 mins. Second leg on a new A321 with touchscreen entertainment. Crew were polite and efficient. Snack served on this 40minute flight consisted of a savoury and sweet breakfast - which was horrible. A microwaved sandwich and a muffin. Return DXB-DOH again new A321 crew once again polite efficient and friendly. Awful snack once more. DOH-LHR leg was disappointing. The flight was full and on a A330 which was clearly showing its age. Old style IFE - with controller inbuilt into the armrest - which makes it very awkward to operate. Crew were clearly over stretched and somewhat inexperienced forgetting requests and serving wrong meals. I will continue to fly QR but the decline in catering is a concern. Also I have noticed that some crew lack the hospitality which has made QR deserve its 5* status. I remain committed to flying QR whenever possible and will continue to recommend.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2341,2013-09-24,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,O Hammoudy,Egypt,2013-09-24,MCT-DOH-CAI. First leg served with an old and cramped A320. Inflight catering for that leg was not the best just an average snack crew members were doing a good job on that sector. Transit in Doha was a short one around 2 hrs. The terminal itself is so boring if compared to EK's T3 at DXB with a very limited food outlets and coffee shops. The Second leg was served with the companies pride not the 787 but the 777-300ER I would say that the aircraft is pretty much enjoyable in the 3-3-3 abreast layout over Emirates 3-4-3 which gives a feeling of flying a budget airline. Cabin crew on the second leg were just missing the proficiency of a five star airline. Wont hesitate to fly QR again for the sake of the cheap fares.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2342,2013-09-24,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Alan Gibb,Hong Kong,2013-09-24,We flew to Manchester from HK last month with our baby son. On 3 legs of the trip the service and general experience could not be faulted in particular the cabin crew were genuinely caring for our son providing him with chocolates toys and carrying him around the airplane. On the Doha - Manchester leg of the journey the service was appalling very offhand perhaps not helped by the fact there were extra demands on the attendants due to the fact the in-flight entertainment was not working but our baby son was ignored right down to fact there was no offer of baby food for him! So 3 legs unsurpassed service far superior to my experience on my regular business class airlines but of course what one remembers unfortunately was the one poor experience which was made more memorable by how good the rest of the journey was.,,Business Class,,,N/A,,

Seats were of good comfort in economy and leg room was good as well. Inflight entertainment had a large number of choices to choose from. A bit of everything for everyone. Was travelling with a 5 Year old and catered their needs well as well as giving well presented child's meal. Only the transfer at Doha needs to improve a bit as having go by coach to the transit and aircraft is annoying. But overall very good and the best service I have had on anyone airline I have travelled that includes BA Virgin and emirates.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Generally extremely Professional and experienced crew. In recent times have noticed that the quality of Food can be much better. I generally choose AVML as the Choice. On the last flight from DOH-OSL I was served a chicken sandwich instead of vegetarian. Been served Pasta as AVML on one of the flights. Food quality is one thing that I believe that QR has dropped in. Customer service is still good (even if an occasional mistake happens). The thing that I did not like on my OSL-DOH flight is that they introduced the 787. I would any day prefer the Comfort of the 777-300ER.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Last flight (Doha to London) was awful. Old A330 very smelly not especially clean and rubbish in-flight entertainment. A real disappointment but would not put me off flying Qatar again as generally excellent.

2349,2013-09-15,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,K Daidola,Spain,2013-09-15,Had high expectations flying with this 5 star airline. We decided on the route MAD-DOH-BKK-DOH-MAD to fly with Qatar for the first time. It was basically all above average but a bit short for a 5 star. No surprises all was efficient smooth and professional. The 777-300 was used on all our four flights. Great entertainment system although the boxes takes up some leg space. Food was correct and service professional but felt quite robotic. Drinks were served frequently during the flights. Planes were all clean and in very good appearance. Doha airport is a problem long bus rides to and from the plane. This will be solved once the new airport opens. We hoped for it to be so before our trip but they still have no date.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly. I am very much looking forward to flying Qatar again.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Good Oryx system great headsets and good choice of films. Food excellent and as much drink as you like. The only disappointment was the 'fast track' luggage.

QR30. 2 Aug and returned departing 25 August QR31 to Doha and 27 Aug QR702 to Seychelles. While in general we were satisfied with the flights there are a number of issues I would like to raise: 1) We were seated in row 24 on QR30 about halfway down economy. When the meal trolley came we were told instead of the 3 meal options only one was still available. 2) When I asked for a glass of wine I was told it would be brought later. It arrived after my meal was finished. 3) On the return leg my wife who has a bladder problem asked if the trolley could be moved to allow her out. She was told she would have to wait until the attendants had finished and were ready to move on. 4) QR31 25 August was heavily booked. When the lights were brightened after approximately 10 hours there was naturally a rush for the toilets. The number provided on the 777 is in my opinion inadequate. Long queues soon formed.,,Economy Class,,,no,,

Staff were very attentive plenty of drinks offered between meals. Food was adequate and on the longer legs there were sandwiches and cakes available in the galley. Seating comfortable the 3-3-3 configuration helps enormously. I was able to stretch out a bit due to some empty seats on the longer legs but even on the packed DOH-LHR flights it was great to have the leg room. The Oryx entertainment system was fine for me.

A good flight overall but it quality of service went without a doubt down those last months. Always the same mess at DXB Terminal 1 check-in counter Dnata handling group is really a disaster. For this only reason you might prefer to fly Emirates which does not outsource its Terminal 3 to Dnata. Doha airport also was chaotic with very long bus rides and disorganized ground staff.

A frequent flyer with Qatar since 2009 I can say that they have really gone ""downhill"" and no longer deserve a 5* rating in economy class. While the aircraft are still modern with new aircraft always arriving the seats spacious (except for 787) and the in-flight entertainment is good the food and drinks have really become poor. They are as bad now as on many US carriers or worse. In contrast in 2009 Qatar had gourmet restaurant quality food. The levels and quality of service from most cabin crews has also declined to being very average. It is very rare for example to see a tray of drinks being carried around now between meals.

First sector was served with a very newish A320 which to me offered more comfort than travelling on an A330 or even a 77W the small a/c came equipped with PTVs wide selection of audio and video entertainment all you need and more for this medium haul flight. Food was better than my last EK trip last week but served in very small amounts. Transit in Doha was critically short in time however its nowhere close to EK's T3 at DXB. The next leg was a short hop to Muscat served with a very old and torn out A320 with over head entertainment system. Bottom line I choose QR because they offer the best fare every time I fly this route and its worth every penny.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,

Nice cabin interior cabin crew responded quickly to the call button. Meal adequate for a two and a half hour flight in Y class. No news papers or magazines but the Oryx inflight entertainment would keep you from getting bored. Baggage allowance of 23kg adequate for a long weekend in Bali but Emirates and Etihad are now giving 30kg.

2364,2013-08-12,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R Nash,Australia,2013-08-12,Flew first class CAI-DOH on QR503 on 8th Aug 2013. Qatar VIP lounge in CAI is a dump. VIP lounge is roofless and full of flies and A/C is pathetic. Can't really blame Qatar here it's an Egyptian problem. 95% of Qatar staff in CAI were good. Left CAI 20 mins early at 06.00 hrs. Travelled on Airbus A321 and was disappointed to find seats did not fully recline. Stewardesses and stewards were attentive and well-trained. Food and drink on board was top class. Aircraft was clean and fairly new and everything worked. Got to DOH and had 15 hr layover in VIP lounge there which is nothing short of outstanding. Showers TV's free internet recliner beds for snoozing massage chairs manned security lockers family area business facilities. Food and drink availability in VIP lounge is exceptional and all staff were eager to please courteous and well-trained. This airline is punctual and truly a 5 star airline and I will fly with them again anytime.,,First Class,,,N/A,,
2365,2013-08-06,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Gamage Champika,United Arab Emirates,2013-08-06,I took a flight to London on 17th July with my 3.5 year old son and wife. Travelling with kids is not easy as they constantly require something to focus their attention to without which they can easily get irritable. We were hoping that the inflight entertainment system would provide ample entertainment to keep my son occupied. Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything. Eventually it turned out to be a boring flight as well as a stressful one. What's more the pilot did not even acknowledge that there was a problem as he should have at least apologized to all the passengers with regards to this shortcoming.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2366,2013-08-06,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Martin Fernandez,Spain,2013-08-06,MAD-DOH-DXB and back. Boeing 777 in MAD-DOH sectors was nice spacious 3-3-3 configuration and good legroom and IFE. Service and food was good but not outstanding as one expects from a 5-star airline. Boeing 787 in DOH-DXB sectors was amazing very modern and quiet airplane although seating would be a little bit tight for a long haul flight. The worst thing about Qatar Airways is Doha Airport it is very uncomfortable. It was crowded bathrooms were dirty and food options very limited. We had a very long bus ride from the terminal to the plane in the DOH- DXB flight. While boarding for the DOH-MAD flight we had to wait for half an hour for the bus to take us to the plane standing for that time in a crowded and small room at 2am is not a 5-star experience. I won't fly with them again until the opening of the new Doha Airport.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
2367,2013-08-06,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,David Monteiro,Switzerland,2013-08-06,GVA-AUH A320. Good food but after the main meal nothing else was served which I find a bit disappointing. Flight attendants served plenty of drinks throughout the flight. My IFE froze and I asked the FA to try to reset it but she never did. Seat pitch just OK. Overall a good product compared to European carriers.,,Economy Class,,,N/A,,
2368,2013-08-05,3,10,Qatar Airways customer review,A Boorman,United Kingdom,2013-08-05,London Heathrow - Yangon via Doha return. First three flights were okay - check in staff at LHR a little rude. Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet). There was a total lack of organisation with this airline.,,Economy Class,,,no,,
